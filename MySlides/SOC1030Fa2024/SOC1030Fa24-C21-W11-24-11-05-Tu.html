                        ## "Fish" Game

                        - Scenario:
                            - Each of you represents the head of a starving family, which requires food. The only food source for these families is a small fishing pond, which has fish in it
                        - Game setup
                            - Must be in groups of 7
                                - Designate a "Moderator"
                                - Designate a "Recorder": Have paper and pencil/pen ready
                                - Every other participant is a fisher-person: get 6 pennies "fish" from the front
                                - Once every fisher has their pennies the moderators will divide up the remaining pennies evenly between them for the "pot"
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        - Rules:
                            - Participants are not allowed to talk during the game
                            - If there is not enough fish in a round: first come, first serve applies
                            - The Recorder will mark down how many fish each participant has after each round
                                - Put the "fish" into the group pot after each round
                            - The Moderator group member manages the pot and the pond (fish reproduction)
                        - How the game is played:
                            - At the start of the game, there is 30 fish in the pond
                            - Each day (a round of a game), each person can catch 1 to 5 fish
                            - At the end of each round ("night"), the fish in the pond reproduce, and double the size before the next day
                            - The game will be played for five rounds
                                - If the pond is depleted the game ends
                        - In each round:
                            - Moderator says: "Now, the Sun rises at the Xth day, fishermen, go and catch your fish."
                            - After ~20 seconds, fishermen report the fish they catch to the moderator: "Day X, I caught A fish."
                            - Moderator calculates the total number of fish caught, and subtract it from the pool.
                            - Moderator says: "Now the Sun sets, and the fish in the pond doubles in the amount." Double the amount and write it in the "Total fish at the morning" in the next day.
                            - At the end of the fifth round, moderator says, "Now the game ends."

                            - How the rules of the game can be changed to avoid running out of fish
                            - How does the game change if there are more or fewer fishers

                            - The tragedy of the commons is a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, <span style="color: red">acting independently</span> according to their own <span style="color: red">self-interest</span>, behave contrary to the <span style="color: red">common good</span> of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their collective action.

                            - Private Good(s): a good that is <span style="color: red">excludable</span> (access can be denied)
                                - i.e. owners can exercise private property rights, preventing those who have not paid for it from using the good or consuming its benefits
                                - Examples: Smart phones, university parking lot
                            - Public Good(s) (or the commons): a good that is both <span style="color: red">non-excludable</span> in that individuals cannot be excluded from use or could be enjoyed without paying for it. ([from Wikipeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons))
                                - Examples: clean air, quietness in the night, atmosphere, oceans, rivers, ocean fish stocks, or even an office refrigerator

                        ## Tragedy of the Commons

                        - Unregulated grazing on common land in Great Britain and Ireland -- William Forster Lloyd (1833) 
                        - "Tragedy of the commons" - [Garrett Hardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hardin) (1968)
                        - Governing the Commons - [Elinor Ostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom) (1990)
                            - Who has rights to access and use resources?
                            - How much of the resources can be withdrawn?
                            - Who will monitor whether the resource is being used according to the set of rules?
                            - How to punish those who break the rules?
                            - Who will decide what the rules are?
                            - What to do in case of a disagreement?
                        - Rather than privatization of the common resources, or controlled and monitored by the State, people can often self-organize themselves in order to successfully manage their resources by *creating a whole system of social institutions*.

                        ## Hardin's Theory vs Ostrom's Findings

                        - Hardin's theory:
                            - If each herdsman sharing a piece of common grazing land made the individually rational economic decision of increasing the number of cattle he keeps on the land, the collective effect would deplete or destroy the commons
                        - Elinor Ostrom's findings:
                            - She spent time with traditional communities whose life and economy largely dependent on a natural resource base
                            - Switzerland and Japan (mountain meadows), Spain and Philippines (Irrigation system); Nepal (forest); Indonesia (Fisheries)
                            - Ostrom finds that each of these communities have developed their own set of rules for determining how to use their natural resources
                            - Disproved Hardin's theory by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources

                        ## Tragedy of the Commons Today

                        - Supreme Court challenging institutions that regulate many of our "commons"
                        - Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024) and Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce (2024)
                            - Together overturned Chevron deference (Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (1984))
                        - Chevron deference: in a case where there was congressional ambiguity (in laws) agencies interpreted the law
                            - Often times congress was vague on purpose (experts at agencies get to make rules)
                            - Now judges must interpret vague language in laws (judges in courts will make rules)
                                - Example: Ohio v. EPA (2024) (what should be included as air pollution)
                                    - In 2015 EPA required states to reduce ozone pollution to comply with the Clean Air Act
                                    - Supreme Court (5-4) said they didn't think EPA's new rule was not reasonable (subjective?)
                                        - [Justice Gorsuch confused "nitrous oxide" with "nitrogen oxide"](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/supreme-court-corrects-epa-opinion-after-gorsuch-confuses-laughing-gas-with-air-pollutant/ar-BB1p3mTJ)
                        - Corner Post Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2024)
                            - Previously any regulation could be challenged in court but only within a certain time-frame prior to and up to 6 years after the regulation took effect (statute of limitations)
                            - This case now allows challenging of any regulation from the time the regulation started to take effect on an organization/business
                                - Any business can now be created to specifically challenge long established regulations

                        - What are some social problems that intersect with the concept of the tragedy of the commons?
                        - Using the internet find one example and be ready to describe the social problem and how it is an example of the tragedy of the commons
                        - How might the changes made to Chevron deference and other related Supreme Court decisions easier or harder to deal with social problems?
                            - How might these decisions impact social problems that are tragedy of the commons easier or harder to deal with?
