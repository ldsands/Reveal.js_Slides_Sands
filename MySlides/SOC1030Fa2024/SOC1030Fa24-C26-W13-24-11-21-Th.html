                    ## Fields and Framing

                    - **Framing or Meaning Construction:** the active dynamic and evolving process through which actors develop perceptions and interpretations of reality (Benford and Snow 2000)
                        - Usually focused around words and concepts
                        - Often called frames

                    <script type="text/template">
                        ## Fields and Framing Example

                        - What comes to mind when you hear "free and fair election(s)"
                        - What comes to mind when you hear "voter fraud"
                        - What comes to mind when you hear "voter suppression"
                        - Shelby County v. Holder (2013): no longer required to pass election law changes by Justice Department to make sure they do not have a discriminatory impact <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
                        - Voter fraud is incredibly rare but it is used extensively in political rhetoric (Udani, Kimball, and Fogarty 2018) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
                        - In Georgia many poll locations were closed (Cachon and Kaaua 2023) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
                            - More polls closed in locations with more minority voters ([Stern 2020 Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/georgias-election-was-a-disaster.html)) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
                            - Evidence for vastly longer wait times or major reductions in voter turnout has been thin <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
                        - These are frames that are meant to be used to mobilize resources, and engage the political process for change (Benford and Snow 2000) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

                    ## Bias in Media

                    - Frames are used constantly in political communication and rhetoric
                    - Something that may seem completely innocuous can take on much more meaning when a frame has been developed
                        - Let's Go Brandon vs Dark Brandon
                        - Only those in the know understand the meaning
                        - Dog whistles
                    - Frames are useful in understanding media bias
                    - How can we be informed when so much of media is biased?

                    ## Myths Oddities and Misconceptions Around US Government and Founding

                    - Myth: US was founded as a Christian Nation (Fea 2016)
                        - Reality: many of the founders were deists, the founding documents are very agnostic in what little religious language there is
                    - Myth(ish): The US is the oldest democracy (Foner 2019)
                        - Reality: The constitution was a replacement adopted in 1787 for the Articles of Confederation
                        - Reality: The civil war/reconstruction is sometimes referred to as the second founding because of the drastic changes made to the constitution and other aspects of government
                        - Is not a complete replacement and a civil war where the system was drastically changed failures of the US system of democracy?
                    - Myth: The separation of church and state was created at the founding (Pew Research Center 2009)
                        - Reality: Some states has a state church, the separation of church and state developed over time
                    - Misconception: The founders wanted a 2 party system (Drutman 2020)
                        - The founders explicitly designed a system to prevent any political parties from forming
                        - They were terrified of what two party systems do
                        - 1792 first party formed (only 5 years after the constitution is adopted)
                    - These myths are perpetuated for many reasons
                        - One reason is to stop change to the system as it exists today
                        - Some of these are just not well known

                    ## How Rights Went Wrong (Greene 2021)

                    - **Binary Approach to Rights**: The United States
                        - When the rights of one person or group come into conflict with another on must ALWAYS win
                        - Increases the stakes for every conflict between rights
                    - **Proportionality Approach to Rights**: Germany, Canada, UK and most others
                        - When rights come in conflict the judge decides using the circumstances of the conflict
                        - Allows for recognizing many more rights
                    - Example: Abortion
                        > "In 1975, West Germany's constitutional court heard that country's own momentous abortion case at nearly the same time as Roe, approaching it from a startlingly different perspective. Abortion was illegal in almost all circumstances until the Social Democrats tried to pass a decriminalization law in 1974. The question before the West German court was not whether restrictions on abortion infringed the rights of women but rather whether liberalizing abortion interfered with the rights of fetuses. The court struck down the law for this reason. But rather than structure abortion jurisprudence around the rights of either women or fetuses alone, the court has consistently structured the law around both sets of rights."
                        >
                        > "In practice, this has meant that the German government must take seriously both the constitutional value of women's autonomy and its commitment to fetal life. There, as in the United States, the best way to protect fetal  life is not to outlaw abortion (which only drives the practice underground)  but rather to provide women with meaningful alternatives to termination." (Greene 2021)
                        - Decriminalized abortion for first trimester only but are very easy to obtain
                        - Government provides for free or cheap many services and other incentives to make abortions less common
                    - There isn't anything explicitly stated in law that says that all rights when they come in conflict HAVE to have one winner

                    ## Corporate Rights

                    - We the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights (Winkler 2018)
                        > "by long and constant acceptance . . . been held to embrace artificial persons as well as natural persons" Roscoe Conkling
                        - On behalf of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company argued that under the 14th Amendment that corporations were "persons"
                        - The 14th Amendment was the amendment that secured freedom for the enslaved
                    - Lochner v. New York (1905)
                        - "maximum working hours for bakers violated the bakers' right to freedom of contract under the Fourteenth Amendment" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochner_v._New_York))
                    - Citizens United v. FEC (2010)
                        - "the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for political campaigns by corporations" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC))
                    - Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (2014)
                        - "allowing privately held for-profit corporations to be exempt from a regulation that its owners religiously object to" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burwell_v._Hobby_Lobby_Stores,_Inc.))

                    ## Political Polarization and Political Structure

                    - Structural Functionalism: functional structure persist
                        - This doesn't mean that something can't be better than current structures
                    - Political Structure dictates outcomes!
                        - First past the post systems inevitably lead to a 2 party system
                        - Leads to voting based on who you hate more (more polarization)
                        - Leads to gerrymandering

                    ## Three Examples of Gun Control

                    - Australia ([RAND](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/essays/1996-national-firearms-agreement.html) and [Wendover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0aGGOK4kAM))
                        - 1996 Port Arthur Massacre
                        - Banned most types of semi-automatic rifles in 12 days
                        - Not the first attempt (1987)
                    - New Zealand ([PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/why-the-u-s-and-new-zealands-responses-to-mass-shootings-are-so-different) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_law_in_New_Zealand))
                        - 2019 Christchruch Mosque Shootings
                        - Banned all military rifles and many other kinds of guns in 28 days
                    - United States ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/congress-gun-violence-bill-live-updates-20f7c9738fee4eba1d7fed155301ee25))
                        - First federal gun reform passed 2022 first time in decades
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Why This Example?

                    - Not really about gun laws
                    - All three had strong culture of gun ownership
                    - All three had mass shootings
                    - All three had strong support to change the laws
                    - All about policy and the ability to implement it
                    - Three different systems with a different number of veto points
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Veto Points in Government

                    - **Veto Point**: the place in government where policy can be rejected
                    - New Zealand (1 veto point)
                        - Unicameral (Prime minister is part of the parliament)
                        - That's it no other veto points
                            - Same system: Finland, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Norway
                            - Similar but different systems with one veto point: UK, Ireland, Austria, France
                    - Australia (3 veto points)
                        - Bicameral, both chambers have to pass a law (some more complicated veto ability by the cantons or member states)
                            - Very similar to Switzerland

                            - House needs simple majority
