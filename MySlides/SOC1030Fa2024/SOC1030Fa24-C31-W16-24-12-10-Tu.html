                    ## Medical Sociology and the Social Determinates of Health

                    > "There I am standing by the shore of a swiftly flowing river and I hear the cry of a drowning man. So I jump into the river, put my arms around him, pull him to shore and apply artificial respiration. just when he begins to breathe, there is another cry for help. So i jump into the river, reach him, pull him to shore, apply artificial respiration, and then just as he begins to breathe, another cry for help. So back in the river again, reaching, pulling, applying, breathing and then another yell. Again and again, without end, goes the sequence. You know, I am so busy jumping in, pulling them to shore, applying artificial respiration, that I have no time to see who the hell is upstream pushing them all in."
                    >

                    ## Effects of Poverty on Health
                
                    - Most of the poor will live in areas that have low home and rent values (Desmond 2017)
                    - Frequently these areas have lower values due to the presence of dirty industry
                        - Example: cancer causing air pollution [ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/toxmap/)
                    - These companies will have high levels of pollution nearby causing health problems for the local residents
                        - Example: central (Rich) vs South Phoenix (Industry) (Bolin, Grineski, and Collins 2005)

                    ## Effects of Environment on Health

                    - We've talked about this in other classes
                    - Example: The crown Season 1 Episode 4 "Act of God"
                        - "Great Smog of London" 5-9 December 1952
                        - [4000 dead (contemporary estimate) 10,000-12,000 killed (modern estimates)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smog_of_London)
                    - Example: Inversions in Utah
                        - Trap air for weeks at a time due to "bowl" like effect of mountains
                        - During inversions Utah usually has worst air quality in the world

                    ## Effects of Water on Health

                    - ~90% of available American fresh water is groundwater ([American Geosciences Institute 2017](https://www.americangeosciences.org/geoscience-currents/groundwater-use-united-states))
                        - Most aquifers are losing volume (due to human extraction)
                    - Many of the chemicals we create eventually can and do leech into groundwater
                        - Water treatment can remove many of these but that takes money and some are more expensive to remove than others

                    ## Effects of Occupation on Health

                    - What jobs have you had that can be dangerous?
                        - My jobs (Pool, Plasma, Virology)
                    - Unions and OSHA inspections (Weil 1991)
                    > "The analysis demonstrates that unionized establishments are more likely to receive safety and health inspections, face greater scrutiny in the course of those inspections, and pay higher penalties for violating health and safety standards than comparable nonunion establishments."

                    - Problem
                        - Obesity causes lots of money time and suffering throughout the US and obesity rates are about 1/3. Obesity causes diabetes which is a costly and painful disease
                    - Action
                        - Shame those who are obese so that there will be a strong desire on the part of everyone to either lose weight or maintain a healthy weight
                    - Why we should
                        - This will prevent many people from becoming obese or decrease the rates at which they gain weight, thereby preventing disease and the ill effects that come with it
                    - Why we shouldn't
                        - There will be an increase in the rates of suicide, eating disorders, and poor self image for many americans that have difficulty with their weight

                        - Opioid Epidemic, Illegal drugs, Suicide, Car Accidents, Obesity
                    - Explain why this health issue is a problem
                    - Describe an action that could be taken (from an upstream perspective)
                    - Explain why we should do it
                    - Explain why we shouldn't do it

                    ## The Outcomes That Matter

                    - What are the outcomes that matter when discussing public health
                        - Might sociologists use different outcomes than public health professionals?
                    - **Life Expectancy**: average remaining years until death for any given age
                    - **Maternal Mortality**: the death of a woman during or up to a year after the end of the pregnancy
                    - **Infant Mortality**: an infant death before the age of 12 months

                    ## Abortion in the US
                
                    - We previously talked about the history of abortion in the US
                        - Abortion before quickening only started to be banned widely in the 1800s
                    - Roe v. Wade (1973) - Allowed abortion with doctor approval (with increasing restrictions allowed in increasing trimesters)
                    - Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) - Partially overruled Roe, allowed for imposing laws enabling waiting periods, spousal notice, parental consent and many other restrictions
                    - Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022) - Overruled Roe and following rulings, enables states to enact any restrictions on abortion
                        - Some exceptions are being litigated
                            - Example: Moyle v. United States (2024) EMTALA requiring abortion for "stabilizing care" Supreme Court "punted" will take up similar case this year
                        - Comstock Act of 1873: Mentioned by law number in SCOTUS arguments this year, illegal to mail abortion related material (including medication, abortion related tools etc.)
                            - Mentioned by two SCOTUS (on by the section number 18 U.S.C. 1461)
                    - Post Dobbs impacts on Maternal Mortality?
                        - It's complicated partly due to COVID

                    - Many in the US do not have insurance
                    - You all have limited health insurance through the UI it is included in your fees
                        - Go to https://studenthealth.uiowa.edu/services/ for more info
                    - Oregon Study Medicaid Lottery 2008
                        - Had extra money for Medicaid used lottery to give to some applicants and not others (natural experiment)
                        - Followed both those with new Medicaid coverage and those without
                        - Graphs about this experiment come from various years

                    ## Insurance in the US
                
                    - Those who do not have insurance have more financial issues
                    - **Under-insured**: insured all year but experienced one of the following
                        - Out-of-pocket expenses equaled 10% or more of income
                        - Out-of-pocket expenses 5% or more of income if low income (less than 200% type of poverty)
                        - Deductibles equaled 5% or more of income
                        - In simpler terms spending a significant amount of income on insurance

                    ## Comparative Health Systems

                    - Bismarck Model
                        - In Germany, Japan, Belgium, Switzerland
                        - Private health insurance companies
                        - Financed through payroll tax and unemployed through federal insurance employers and employees pay through payroll deduction
                        - Everybody is covered (this is the big difference between us and Bismarck Model)
                        - Also insurers are not for profit (the other big difference between us and Bismarck Model)

                    ## Comparative Health Systems

                    - The Beveridge Model
                        - Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Most of Scandinavia
                        - Medical treatment is a public service - financed by the government through taxes = single payer
                        - No medical bills
                        - Public and private doctors (mostly public)

                        - Canada, Australia, Taiwan, South Korea
                        - Health care providers are private, but he government-run health insurer is the payer = single payer
                        - Every citizen pays into this insurance program

                        - Medical care paid for by the patient, out of pocket, with no insurance or government plan to help
                        - Utah State University build on land that someone paid to a doctor for a surgery he had

                    ## Comparative Health Systems

                    - The US system
                        - Working people under 65 (but not all) = Bismarck, but for profit
                        - Native Americans, military, veterans = Beveridge Model
                        - Over 65 = National Health Insurance
                        - Uninsured = Out-of-pocket
                        - Health Cooperative not for profit insurance and provider
                        - This is a massive oversimplification

                            - Monopolies in many areas
