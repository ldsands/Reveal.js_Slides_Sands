                        ## Policing is Dangerous Work

                        - In 2018, for instance, 144 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty, 52 of whom were killed by gunfire (National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund 2018).
                        - Work-related injuries including assaults, transportation accidents etc.
                        - Police frequently interact with people in moments of crisis
                        - Responding to violent crime is dangerous
                            - This is especially true in the United States, where guns are easily accessible
                        - Increased risk of occupational stress, compassion fatigue, depression, burnout, and even suicide

                        ### Philip Zimbardo's Vandalism Experiment (Zimbardo 1969)
                        > He arranged to have an automobile without license plates parked with its hood up on a street in the Bronx and a comparable automobile on a street in Palo Alto, California. The car in the Bronx was attacked by "vandals" within ten minutes of its "abandonment." The first to arrive were a family—father, mother, and young son—who removed the radiator and battery. Within twenty-four hours, virtually everything of value had been removed. Then random destruction began—windows were smashed, parts torn off, upholstery ripped. Children began to use the car as a playground. Most of the adult "vandals" were well-dressed, apparently clean-cut whites. The car in Palo Alto sat untouched for more than a week. Then Zimbardo smashed part of it with a sledgehammer. Soon, passersby were joining in. Within a few hours, the car had been turned upside down (Kelling and Wilson 1982)

                        ## Broken Windows Policing and Theory of Deviance

                        - **Broken windows theory of deviance**: social context and social cues impact the way individuals act, if there is disorder there will be more deviant behavior
                            - The context impacts how individuals think about what informal norms and behaviors are acceptable (or at least more acceptable)
                        - Phrased differently:
                            - **Broken windows theory of deviance**: social context and social cues impact the way individuals act, if there is disorder there will be more deviant behavior

                        ## Evidence for Broken Windows

                        - Labeling theory predicts that:
                            - The ways other people see you affect your behavior
                        - Similarly ...
                        - Broken windows theory predicts that:
                            - The way you see your social surroundings also affect behavior
                        - Graffiti Experiment
                        - George Kelling hired by NY Transit Authority in 1984 (Sloan-Howitt and Kelling 1990)
                            - devised a plan to crack down on graffiti
                            - graffiti-covered cars -> more graffiti and perhaps even violent crimes
                            - The Transit Authority "launched a massive campaign" to clean up all the graffiti within 2 hours
                        - Later in the 1990s Rudy Giuliani also initiated a crime reduction campaign
                            - Targeted petty crimes like public urination, the drinking of alcohol in public, and graffiti
                        - Since these campaigns the rates of nearly all crimes have fallen

                        - it burdens poor residents with fines, court dates, and fees for minor violations

                        ## Stop-and-Frisk

                        - Stop-and-frisk, also called a Terry stop, is a practice that permits police to temporarily detain a person, question them, and search them for weapons or other contraband if they have "reasonable suspicion" that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime
                        - The stop-and-frisk practice by NYPD during the 1990s has been widely credited as a major source of the city's sharp crime decline (Zimring 2007)

                        - A 15-month data of all stops (~175,000) by NYPD from Jan 1998 through Mar 1999 (Gelman, Fagan, and Kiss 2007)
                            - Blacks and Hispanics stopped more often than whites 
                                - Controlled for population of each group 
                                - Also controlled for rates of crimes committed by each group
                            - For violent crimes and weapons offenses
                                - Blacks and Hispanics were stopped about twice as often as whites
                            - Stops of blacks and Hispanics were less likely to lead to arrest than those of whites

                        ## Group Discussion

                        - What explain these findings (higher stop rates but lower arrest rates) based on what we have learned about race and racism?
                            - Targeting of minorities <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

                        - The authors also found evidence that stops can be explained as "racial incongruity" stops (Gelman, Fagan, and Kiss 2007):<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
                            - Very high rates of stops of minorities in predominantly White precincts  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

                        ## Driving while black

                        - **Driving while black**: "In the two-year period from January 1995 to December 1997, about 70 percent of the drivers stopped and searched by the police were black, while only 17.5 percent of overall drivers—as well as speeders—were black." (Cole 1999)
                        - Black Drivers are far more likely to have their cars searched but roughly equally likely to have contraband when compared with White drivers (LaFraniere and Lehren 2015)

                        - **Veil of Darkness**: racial differences lessen or disappear when police cannot determine the race of drivers
                        - "We found that black drivers were less likely to be stopped after sunset, when a 'veil of darkness' masks one's race, suggesting bias in stop decisions." (Pierson et al. 2020)
                        - Rates for pull overs for African-Americans go down after sunset (Pierson et al. 2020)

                        - Go to this website: [https://disa.com/marijuana-legality-by-state](https://disa.com/marijuana-legality-by-state)
                            - Examine Marijuana Laws by State
                            - First examine a state you know well (where you grew up)
                            - Then select a state you don't know well that has different laws from your first state
                            - In your group compare the different types of laws you looked at
                            - Note: Some states may have incomplete information, if you're having troubles comparing the states you selected then change states
                        - Discuss how these laws exemplify social construction
                            - Think about the terms social deviance, and crime as you discuss this
                        - Using what you learned discuss and write down how these laws relate to the terms listed below
                            - Social cohesion and collective conscience, mechanical and organic solidarity, punitive and rehabilitative justice, labeling theory, shared meanings, broken windows theory of deviance
