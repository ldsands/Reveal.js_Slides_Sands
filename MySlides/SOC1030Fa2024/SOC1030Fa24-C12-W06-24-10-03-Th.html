                        ## Institutional Racism

                        - **Institutional racism** (**Systemic racism**) is a form of racism that is embedded as normal practice within society or an organization
                        - Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton in 1960s
                        - Harder to identify and therefore less often condemned by society (because no one is to blame)
                            - Think about the effect of redlining or the GI bill vs events like the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing (1963) 4 dead or the Charleston church shooting (2015) 9 dead
                        - Examples: Schools, banks, redlining and discrimination in housing market, biased law enforcement policies

                        ## Implicit Racial Bias

                        - **Prejudice**: the individual biases and belief systems that attribute characteristics to a group of people so that we prejudge group members
                        - **Racial discrimination**: the differential treatment of people based on their race
                        - **Implicit racial bias**: the subconscious attitudes and stereotypes that individuals hold about people of different racial or ethnic backgrounds, often without conscious awareness
                            - No prejudice, but with discrimination
                        - Example: Implicit Association Tests
                        - Example: the Shooter Bias Study

                        - Assessment intended to detect subconscious associations between mental representations of objects in memory
                        - The speed determines how comfortable or uncomfortable an idea is to the test taker

                        - Joshua Correll, a social psychologist
                        - Racial bias in perceptions of threat and decision-making
                            - Law enforcement and simulated shooting scenarios.
                            - Participants in the study played a video game, in which the goal is to shoot people who had a gun, but not to shoot unarmed players

                        - Participants are more likely 
                            - To mistakenly identify unarmed Black individuals as armed
                            - To shoot them more quickly than White individuals
                        - This bias occurs even when the race of the participant and the race of the target are matched
                        - Training can make a difference

                        ## Statistical Discrimination

                        - **Statistical discrimination**:
                        - A situation in which an individual (e.g. employer) makes a decision about an individual on the basis of beliefs about the average characteristics of a social category rather than the characteristics of the specific individual
                        - Why does this happen?
                            - It is less costly to do decide based on stereotypes, usually not because of an dislike of people in that category
                        - Example: Employers believe that on average a young black man will be a less reliable employee than a young white man with the same formal qualifications, and since it is difficult to get precise information about individual reliability, the employer will rely on presumed group traits to make the choice
                        - Graph below: Callbacks (Pager 2003)

                        ## Color-Blind Attitudes

                        - Color-blind attitudes refer to the belief that race should not be a factor in how individuals are treated and that everyone should be treated equally regardless of race
                        - Should we embrace a color-blind attitudes towards social practices in work place, social encounters, and public policies?

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## "Color-Blind Racism" (Bonilla-Silva) 

                        - Color-Blind Racism is the view that racial inequality is perpetuated by a supposedly color-blind stance that ends up reinforcing historical and contemporary inequalities, disparate impact, and institutional bias by “ignoring” them in favor of a technically neutral approach
                        - "race neutral" rhetoric relies more on culture and nationality to explain differences between nonwhites and whites than immutable physical traits

                        ## Historic Achievement

                        - Dismantling of the machinery of legal racial segregation and oppression and erosion of cultural supports for racism.
                        - Progress is real:
                            - African-Americans in ads and on TV
                            - Acceptability of inter-racial marriage
                            - Emergence of a vibrant black middle class
                            - Positive images are common
                            - Political visibility: Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Barak Obama, Kamala Harris

                        ## Implications of Race

                        - Despite being socially constructed race has real and often massive implications on
                            - Unemployment rates
                            - Crime rates (in future classes)
                            - Arrest rates and rates of imprisonment (in future classes)
                            - Familial structure (in future classes)

                        ## Civil Rights and Retrenchment

                        - Voting Rights Act (1965)
                            - Has 3 major ways to protect minority (mostly Black) voting
                                - Preclearance: all changes to voting laws made in parts of the country with racist history must get those laws reviewed by the DOJ
                                - "Intent test": cannot enact laws with the intent to make it harder for minorities to vote
                                - "Results test": even if the intent isn't racially explicit if the impact is disproportionally impacting minorities then it is illegal
                        - Shelby County v. Holder (2013)
                            - Eliminated preclearance
                            - Example impact: allows states to eliminate polling places (mostly in minority areas) leading to long lines
                        - Abbott v. Perez (2018)
                            - Made it nearly impossible to prove racial gerrymandering in court
                            - Example impact: can gerrymander minorities using any other measure other than race
                        - Brnovich v. DNC (2021)
                            - Makes the results test incredibly difficult to pass
                            - Example impact: allows for banning of ballot collection (also shown to be used more by minority voters e.g. souls to the polls)
                            - Example impact: allows dismissal of out of precinct votes (minority districts shown to change far more often)

                        ## Civil Rights and Retrenchment

                        - Students for Fair Admissions v. University of NC (Oral Arguments 2022-10-31) Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson
                        > The first applicant says: I'm from North Carolina. My family has been in this area for generations, since before the Civil War, and I would like you to know that I will be the fifth generation to graduate from the University of North Carolina. I now have that opportunity to -- to do that, and given my family background, it's important to me that I get to attend this university. I want to honor my family's legacy by going to this school.
                        >
                        > The second applicant says, I'm from North Carolina, my family's been in this area for generations, since before the Civil War, but they were slaves and never had a chance to attend this venerable institution. As an African American, I now have that opportunity, and given my family -- family background, it's important to me to attend this university. I want to honor my family legacy by going to this school.
                        >
                        > Now, as I understand your no-race-conscious admissions rule, these two applicants would have a dramatically different opportunity to tell their family stories and to have them count.
                        >
                        > The first applicant would be able to have his family background considered and valued by the institution as part of its consideration of whether or not to admit him, while the second one wouldn't be able to because his story is in many ways bound up with his race and with the race of his ancestors.
                        >
                        > So I want to know, based on how your rule would likely play out in scenarios like that, why excluding consideration of race in a situation in which the person is not saying that his race is something that has impacted him in a negative way, he just wants to have it honored, just like the other person has their personal background family story honored, why is telling him no not an equal protection violation?

                        ## Group Discussion

                        - Using terms from the last slide discuss arguments on both sides of taking a color-blind approach to race
                            - Make a list of arguments (pros and cons)
                        - Affirmative action (race conscious admissions) for universities is now illegal, read the quotes below and discuss how these quotes related to the following terms:
                            - implicit racial bias, color-blind attitudes, color-blind racism and Statistical discrimination
                            - "Many universities have for too long...concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin," Chief Justice John Roberts
                            - "With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces 'colorblindness for all' by legal fiat. But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life." Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson
