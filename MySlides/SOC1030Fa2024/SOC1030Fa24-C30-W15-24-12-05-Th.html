                    - Write down 3 things that you think could be improved within the educational system (K-12, University or some other aspect of education) and what you would do to fix them

                    - What did you write down?
                    - Since all of you have many years of experience in education you are all experts, right?
                    - This is a reason why reforming education is so difficult, EVERYONE has an opinion
                    - Common Core: "The Common Core State Standards Initiative, also known as simply Common Core, was an American, multi-state educational initiative begun in 2010 with the goal of increasing consistency across state standards, or what K-12 students throughout the United States should know in English language arts and mathematics at the conclusion of each school grade." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core))
                        - What are your thoughts on common core?

                    ## Education and Socialization

                    - **Education**: "the process through which a society transmits its culture and history, as well as teaches social, intellectual, and specific work skills that result in productive workers and citizens" (Korgen and Atkinson 2021)
                    - **Socialization**: the process of being taught and absorbing norms, values, beliefs, habits etc. - in other words culture (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                    - **Hidden Curriculum**: implicit messages taught in schools
                        - a latent function of school that reinforces social order and status
                        - Examples: gender, racial, class and other role appropriate behaviors
                    - Schools are a focal point for conflict in part because of the strong beliefs about what children should or should not be taught

                    ### Fighting Over Culture in Schools
                
                    - 1619 Project vs 1776 Commission
                    > The 1619 Project has come under serious fire from reputable historians, who point out the use of erroneous claims as it pertains to our nation's founding and economic system. Among the most incendiary is Nikole Hannah-Jones' opinion that the Revolution was fought to preserve the institution of slavery from a Great Britain that wanted to end it, which she passes off as “fact.”1 This statement in particular jumped out at me due to the irresponsibility of a journalist claiming her opinion as fact. Her justification for this claim is also weak — that there was a growing abolition movement Britain at the time. This ignores the fact that there was also a growing abolition movement in the 13 colonies, and many of the Founding Fathers were anti-slavery and started or joined abolition societies shortly after the war. In addition to that, eight states passed gradual abolition laws between 1777-1804, which makes for a lot of people who supposedly fought to preserve slavery only to do an about-face a few years later. Jones fails to provide any evidence that the institution of slavery was under imminent threat from Great Britain, who was profiting immensely off the transatlantic slave trade at the time and didn't abolish slavery throughout its colonial empire until almost six decades after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence.
                    >
                    > The 1776 Committee Report is even more flawed. Its writing is convoluted and sounds more like an opinionated, partisan diatribe than serious academic scholarship about history. One of the most creative, interpretive spins levied upon a historical time period is in regards to the Progressive Era. In the eyes of the writers, this was a time when the elites decided to forsake the nation's founding ideals because industrialization had rendered them out outdated. Conveniently, nothing about the dangerous working conditions in factories, lack of safety and health codes that led to disasters such as the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, or the Nadir of race relations is mentioned.2 Other egregious historical manipulations include the likening of the Pro-life movement of the last few decades to the Civil Rights and Gay Rights movements, and the connection the document attempts to make between present-day identity politics and the racial theories of John C. Calhoun, one of the 19th century's staunchest defenders of slavery and the states' right of nullification.

                    - What do these two documents reveal about the motivations of the authors?
                    - How does the targeting of schools for disseminating these materials show the importance of school socialization?

                    ## School Funding and Inequality

                    - Public Schools are funded by a combination of funds from federal, state and local sources
                    - **Nearly half of funding comes from local property taxes**
                        - This leads to sometimes large disparities between schools located in wealthy and impoverished communities

                    ## Money Spent on Education Correlates with Outcomes

                    - **"Spending and Outcomes Tend to Move Together"** (Jackson 2020)
                        - Not all school inequality comes down to money but it is an important factor (Jackson 2020)
                    > "While one can poke holes in each individual study, the robustness of the patterns across a variety of settings is compelling evidence of a real positive causal relationship between increased school spending and student outcomes on average" ([Daarel Burnette II, Education Week](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/student-outcomes-does-more-money-really-matter/2019/06))

                    ## Other Factors of Educational Outcomes

                    - Working class students often have less structured activities as children (Lareau 2011)
                        - This makes transitions into school (highly structured environment) more jarring
                    - Students from households with more educated parents are "coached for the classroom" (Calarco 2018)
                    - Both of these circumstances can lead to labels being applied to children
                        - "Troublemaker" label can lead to discipline especially for minority children (Marsh and Noguera 2018)
                        - "Smart" label can lead to tracking into more advanced courses

                        - Labeling theory is useful in school research
                        - Discipline in schools follows predictable racial and gender lines
