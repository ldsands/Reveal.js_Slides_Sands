                        ## War on Drugs

                        - In June 1971, President Nixon officially declared a "War on Drugs," stating that drug abuse was "public enemy number one"
                        - In the 1980s, President Reagan reinforced and expanded many of Nixon's War on Drugs policies
                            - Led to a massive increase in incarcerations for nonviolent drug crimes
                        - Between 2009 and 2013, some 40 states took steps to soften their drug laws, lowering penalties and shortening mandatory minimum sentences
                        - In 2010, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA), which reduced the discrepancy between crack and powder cocaine offenses to 18:1

                        ## War on Drugs

                        - In 1986, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which established **mandatory minimums**
                        - **Mandatory minimums**: prison sentences that incarcerated a minimum amount of time for certain drug offenses
                        - 5 grams of crack cocaine vs. 500 grams of powder cocaine
                            - 5 grams of crack = mandatory minimum of 5 years in Federal prison
                            - 500 grams of power = mandatory minimum of 5 years in Federal prison
                        - Crack is easier to produce and became associated with Black communities, HIV and "crack babies" in the 1980s (Goulian et al. 2022; Reinarman and Levine 1997)
                            - This framing drove the difference between crack and powder cocaine

                        ## Nixon's Enemies

                        > At the time, I was writing a book about the politics of drug prohibition. I started to ask Ehrlichman a series of earnest, wonky questions that he impatiently waved away. "You want to know what this was really all about?" he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect. "The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did." (Baum 2016)

                        >
                        >"Parents also often enter prison with legal financial obligations to their children: More than one-fourth (27%) of parents in state prisons with minor children owe ongoing child support, and most of those (80%), unsurprisingly, owe back pay. Men are more than twice as likely to owe child support (29% of fathers, compared to 14% of mothers)."

                        ## Police Violence and Police Alternatives

                        - Police Violence and Murders have gained attention now that almost everyone has a phone in their pocket
                        - In 2019, police officers shot and killed 1,001 people; half were white, and one quarter were black. 
                        - A "significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans relative to unarmed white Americans" by police. This bias is not seen when suspects were armed. (Ross et al. 2020; Ross 2015)

                        ## Alternative Public Safety Approaches

                        - The US usually uses Police for nearly all emergency response
                        - More demand for alternatives
                            - Black Lives Matter (BLM)
                            - **Defund the Police movement**
                            - Decreasing rates of crime

                        ## Obstacles To Reform

                        - Many individual characteristics of police officers, including racial bias, a bad temper, insecure masculinity and other, are power predictors of police misconduct (Goff and Rau 2020)
                        - Carrying out disciplinary action, let alone firing a police officer, is notoriously difficult in the United States
                        - Partisan disagreement on legislators regulating policing behavior and police immunity
                            - Governor Kim Reynolds signed of a police reform bill on the steps to restrict the use of chokeholds by police and increase officer accountability
                            - Several bills were proposed, including action items such as measures intended to increase police accountability, training and data collection, including a national police misconduct registry to keep record of when an officer is fired or quits; but they failed to pass in Congress

                        ## Should We Defund the Police?

                        - Sides of the argument
                            - Having a strong presence of police department in community
                            - Abolishing the police department entirely
                        - What are the pros and cons of each side of the argument?
                        - Is there a middle road?

                        - A real case where the Police Department was dismantled in Camden, New Jersey
                            - [Camden police reboot is being misused in the debate over police reform](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/16/camden-nj-police-reboot-is-being-misused-debate-over-police-reform/)

                        ## Defund the Police - the Case of Camden Police Reboot
                        
                        - Camden, N.J. over 70,000 residents
                            - The city lost manufacturing jobs since WW2
                            - Experienced "White flight" and suburbanization
                                - Caused disinvestment, leaving behind a bankrupt high-poverty city dependent on state aid since the 1980s
                        - In 2012, Camden, N.J., disbanded its police force
                        - The new force embraced broken windows policing
                            - disorderly conduct shot up 43 percent
                            - Summonses for not maintaining lights or reflectors on vehicles spiked 421 percent
                            - Summonses for riding a bicycle without a bell or a light rose from three to 339
                        - Camden experienced a 23 percent drop in violent crime and a 48 percent drop in nonviolent crime from 2012 to 2018
                        - Police reboot successful?
                            - At the same time as Camden, similar cities across New Jersey had similar drops in crime rates
                        - In 2014 and 2015, a local group pressured the police to rewrite their use-of-force policies
                        - [Camden's use of force decreased (by about 95%) about the time of these changes during 2012-2016, which was not mirrored in other New Jersey cities](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/businessweek/how-camden-new-jersey-reformed-its-police-department)
                        <!-- first in 2015 when joining a de-escalation mentoring program, and again in 2019 when the department went a step further by requiring officers to intercede if another officer was using force inappropriately -->

                        ## Defund the Police - the Case of Camden Police Reboot

                        - Lessons learned from the Camden case. 
                            - Misinterpreting crime statistics — and ignoring historical context — can produce catastrophic policy blunders
                            - The disbanding of the Camden City Police Department was not a silver bullet
                            - Efforts from local activists and watchdogs that eventually pressured the new police force to adopt a new force policy are crucial in the transitioning of the new police force in Camden

                            - Runs a "Mobile Crisis Response Program"
                        - Mobile Crisis Response or MCR (Iowa City)
                            - Dispatches trained crisis councilors
                            - Dispatched via local number (sometimes via 988)
                            - Avoids hospitals and criminal justice system entirely
                        - Co-Response (Cedar Rapids has this)
                            - Dispatches councilors with law enforcement personnel
                            - Dispatched via 911
                            - Avoids Jail and hospitals
                        - Both methods significantly reduced police force, transport to hospitals and increases referrals to community resources

                        ## Decreasing Rates of Crime

                        - In the US rates of crime have been decreasing for decades for various reasons (Spelman 2022)
                        - Saw a spike of some crimes during the COVID lock-downs but that is largely over ([Brennan Center For Justice 2024](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/fbi-data-confirms-drop-most-crimes-2023-especially-murders))
                        - Some incredibly interesting research about this topic
                            - Roe V Wade (abortion) research has shown decrease in crime rates (Donohue and Levitt 2020)
                            - Aging of the population (old people don't commit as many crimes) though this is starting to be disputed more (Mitra, Abedin, and Sen 2023)
                            - And far more
