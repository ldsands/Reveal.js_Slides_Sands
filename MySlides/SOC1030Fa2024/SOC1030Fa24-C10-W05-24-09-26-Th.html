                        ## Quiz 03 Review

                        1. Which of the following is most consistent with the Culture of Poverty argument
                            - A - Poor access to resources leads to low motivation to work
                            - B - Society is partly to blame for poverty
                            - C - Meritocracy <!-- Correct Answer -->
                            - D - The culture of the poor and rich are not very different
                        - A is not correct, the reasoning is that the poor access to resources is a structural problem, the low motivation to work is a culture of poverty making the whole answer a combination much like B
                            - Meritocracy: status is based on merit or accomplishments
                        - Culture of Poverty
                            - Instant-gratification mentality
                            - Lack motivation to work
                            - Personality traits and culture poverty in lower class;
                            - Society is not the one to blame, rather, individuals in lower class are responsible for their own poverty.

                        ## Grade Reminders

                        - Both your bottom 2 quiz and participation scores will be dropped in the final grade calculation
                        - Application Assignment 01 will boost most student's grades
                            - I have over-emphasized the difference in scores between the average papers and the best papers
                        - Quiz questions up until now have been a bit harder on purpose
                        - In other words for almost the whole class your class grades are the lowest they will be for the semester
                        - I can delay posting grades until they are more reflective or I can post them as they come but they'll be lower at the beginning of the course

                        ## Race VS Ethnicity

                        - **Ethnicity**: "a social category of people who share a common culture" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                            - "Ethic groups have a consciousness of their common cultural bond"
                        - **Race**: "a group treated as distinct in society based on certain characteristics" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                            - Race is not a biological classification but a socially constructed classification

                        ## Examples of Race As a Social Construct

                        - Sikh
                        - Irish
                        - Burakumin
                        - Mormons

                        ### Sikh

                        <!-- TODO: review this -->
                        <!-- A questions that the US Supreme Court grappled with in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  -->
                        <!-- If science, here anthropology, is not sufficient to determine race, then, who should?  -->
                        <!-- Naturalization Act of 1906 -->

                        - Who should be classified as white? At the turn of the 20th century, leading anthropologists uniformly classified Asian Indians as members of the Caucasian race.
                        - Bhagat Singh Thind, a Sikh from India, inducted into the US Army in the first World War.
                        - But in 1923,  the Supreme Court, relying on a combination of scientific evidence and "common knowledge," decided to denied Thind of citizenship because he is not qualified as a "free white person."
                        - "The words 'free white persons' are words of common speech, to be interpreted in accordance with the understandings of the common man" (Haney López, 1995).

                        ### Irish

                        <!-- Irish: it was believed that the Irish were a distinct category of people who carried innate differences in their blood, difference that made them permanently inferior to their white American neighbors. [..] Here in a hundred years ago, race is not binary as mostly recognizable whites and blacks.  -->

                        - Irish immigrants in late nineteenth century America struggled to assimilate amid fierce and widespread racism.
                        - In 1790, Congress passed the naturalization law, limiting rights of citizenship to "free white persons." 
                        - Between 1880 and World War I, 25 millions Europeans immigrants arrived. The notion of "free white persons" was reconsidered. The inclusiveness of "white persons" splintered into a range of Anglos and "barbarous" others, including Teutons, Slavs, Celtics, Swedes. 
                        > "[They are] distinctly marked—the small and some what upturned nose, the black tint of the skin.... [They] are ignorant, and as a consequence thereof, are idle, thriftless, poor, intemperate, and barbaria.... Of course they will violate our laws, these wild bisons leaping over the fences which easily restrain the civilized domestic cattle, will commit great crimes of violence, even capital offences, which certainly have increased as of late."

                        ### Burakumin

                        - The Burakumin (部落民) are a minority who can be distinguished from the rest of the Japanese population only by genealogical detectives.
                            - A minority group in Japan, roughly around 1-3%
                            - A group of displaced people in a Feudal war during the fourteenth century, and from then on, they work mostly as executioners, butchers, grave diggers, etc., in jobs that are related to death.
                            - Now a distinct social category, with almost complete social closure, their own occupations, their own reproduction pools, communities, etc. But the irony is that they are identical with other Japanese in genetics and in physical appearance.
                        - Burakumins live in ghettos, and score lower on health, educational achievement, and income compared to their fellow Japanese citizens. 
                        - Because of the social exclusion, Burakumins form one of the largest criminal gangs in Japan, the Yakuza syndicate. 
                            - But the B are less likely to get education, more likely to be unemployed, and in turn, more likely to become criminals, because they don't have other channels of getting a job. When a big corporation interviews someone, they would hire special agent to check whether the applicant is of the Burakumin lineage
                        - The irony is that they are identical with other Japanese in genetics and in physical appearance. So, is the race Burakumin real?
                        - What similarities are there between the Burakumin and African-Americans in the US?

For Simms it was clear and physical evidence of Young's 'disposition to love many.' [...] Her eyes were large and round with a wide vertical opening, similar to the eye of a dove—a bird that mates for life (see figure 1.2). Simms thus concluded, 'In the range of Physiognomy everything partakes of a lower nature when built upon the wide and low form.' The almond-shaped eyes with their 'less vertical measurement' produced an 'exhibition of love' that was 'more bestial in its nature, and has little in common with Monoeroticity, which is pure and angelic in its tone.'"</p>

                        ## Racialization

                        - **Racialization**:The process of assigning people a race, along with the personality, behavioral, and social characteristics associated with that race, based on physical or cultural cues (skin color or speech patterns).
                        - Formal laws and social institutions (from top down)
                        - Media and public opinions (from bottom up)

                        ## Race and Social Construction

                        - What does it mean that race is a socially constructed concept? 
                        - The boundaries between the racial groups change over time.
                        - Traits in physical appearance may not always be the marker of a racial group.
                        - Race is real with real social consequences: The dominant group receives social or economic advantages while the oppressed group are worse off!
                        - Race is a social construction, that is that people in the same society share a common understanding about their relationship on the basis of some assumptions about reality.

                        ## Race VS Racism

                        - **Racism**: Racism is a set of beliefs and social practices in which socially-defined racial classifications intersect forms of **social oppression**. 
                            - A system of racial classification: the basis of a racial classification system can be based on real physical differences, but it can also be based on arbitrary traits, such as culture, geography, or genealogy.
                            - It is a set of beliefs and social practices.
                            - **Social oppression**: it can take the forms of segregation and discrimination, slavery, conflict and genocide.

                        ## Examples of Racism: Rwandan genocide

                        - In Rwanda in 1994, roughly 800,000 Tutsi were murdered by Hutu, mostly by machete in the span of 100 days.
                        - The Hutu and the Tutsi for ages had been living and working together and intermarrying. 
                        - Because of their shared social, cultural, genetic heritages, the Hutus and the Tutsi are indistinguishable, besides their main sources of income. 
                        - The Belgians gave preferential treatment to the Tutsi, which in turn dominated the Hutu. After the independence of Rwanda in 1962, the Hutu took power under a dictatorship masked as a democracy, and their long-standing animosity exploded in 1994 after three years famine.

                        ## The Brown Eyes - Blue Eyes Experiment

                        - Jane Elliott gave the brown-eyed children extra privileges, such as second helpings at lunch, access to the new jungle gym, five extra minutes at recess, sitting in the front of the classroom. 
                        - Elliott would not allow brown-eyed and blue-eyed children to drink from the same water fountain and often chastised the blue-eyed students when they did not follow the exercise's rules or made mistakes.
                        - The "Superior" became arrogant, bossy, and otherwise unpleasant to their "inferior" classmates. Their grades on simple tests were better, and they completed mathematical and reading tasks that had seemed outside their ability before.
                        - On the opposite, the "inferior" classmates also transformed into timid and subservient children who scored more poorly on academic tests
