                        ## Race VS Ethnicity

                        - **Ethnicity**: "a social category of people who share a common culture" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                            - "Ethic groups have a consciousness of their common cultural bond"
                        - **Race**: "a group treated as distinct in society based on certain characteristics" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                            - Race is not a biological classification but a socially constructed classification

                        ## Examples of Race As a Social Construct

                        - Sikh
                        - Irish
                        - Burakumin
                        - Mormons

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Sikh

                        <!-- TODO: review this -->
                        <!-- A questions that the US Supreme Court grappled with in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  -->
                        <!-- If science, here anthropology, is not sufficient to determine race, then, who should?  -->
                        <!-- Naturalization Act of 1906 -->

                        - Who should be classified as white? At the turn of the 20th century, leading anthropologists uniformly classified Asian Indians as members of the Caucasian race.
                        - Bhagat Singh Thind, a Sikh from India, inducted into the US Army in the first World War.
                        - But in 1923,  the Supreme Court, relying on a combination of scientific evidence and "common knowledge," decided to denied Thind of citizenship because he is not qualified as a "free white person."
                        - “The words 'free white persons' are words of common speech, to be interpreted in accordance with the understandings of the common man” (Haney López, 1995).

                        ### Irish

                        <!-- TODO: review this -->
                        <!-- Irish: it was believed that the Irish were a distinct category of people who carried innate differences in their blood, difference that made them permanently inferior to their white American neighbors. [..] Here in a hundred years ago, race is not binary as mostly recognizable whites and blacks.  -->
                        <!-- An anti-immigration cartoon from an 1871 issue of Harper’s Weekly. -->
                        <!-- Think about what and who define a race? -->

                        - Irish immigrants in late nineteenth century America struggled to assimilate amid fierce and widespread racism.
                        - In 1790, Congress passed the naturalization law, limiting rights of citizenship to “free white persons.” 
                        - Between 1880 and World War I, 25 millions Europeans immigrants arrived. The notion of “free white persons” was reconsidered. The inclusiveness of “white persons” splintered into a range of Anglos and “barbarous” others, including Teutons, Slavs, Celtics, Swedes. 
                        > “[They are] distinctly marked—the small and some what upturned nose, the black tint of the skin.... [They] are ignorant, and as a consequence thereof, are idle, thriftless, poor, intemperate, and barbaria.... Of course they will violate our laws, these wild bisons leaping over the fences which easily restrain the civilized domestic cattle, will commit great crimes of violence, even capital offences, which certainly have increased as of late.”

                        ### Burakumin

                        <!-- TODO: review this -->
                        <!-- 1. Burakumin is a minority group in Japan, roughly around 1-3%, depending on the estimates. A group of displaced people in a Feudal war during the fourteenth century, and from then on, they work mostly as executioners, butchers, grave diggers, etc., in jobs that are related to death. Nowadays, the B formed a distinct social category, with almost complete social closure, their own occupations, their own reproduction pools, communities, etc. But the irony is that they are identical with other Japanese in genetics and in physical appearance.  -->
                        <!-- 3-4. But the B are less likely to get education, more likely to be unemployed, and in turn, more likely to become criminals, because they don't have other channels of getting a job. When a big corporation interviews someone, they would hire special agent to check whether the applicant is of the B leanage.  -->
                        <!-- 4. Now do you see some resemblance of B to African Americans in contemporary America; Of course, there is a visible physical difference between whites and blacks, but similar to B, AA are less likely to get good education, more likely to be unemployed, even if they get a job, they are more likely in the bottom of the hierarchy in a company. They are more likely to be arrested for criminal acts.  -->
                        <!-- But, ask yourselves, B becoming criminals is because of their innate quality of a subhuman, or is it because of the social exclusion imposed on them by the dominant social group? Similarly, [... for Blacks] -->

                        - The Burakumin (部落民) are a minority who can be distinguished from the rest of the Japanese population only by genealogical detectives.
                        - Burakumins live in ghettos, and score lower on health, educational achievement, and income compared to their fellow Japanese citizens. 
                        - Because of the social exclusion, Burakumins form one of the largest criminal gangs in Japan, the Yakuza syndicate. 
                        - The irony is that they are identical with other Japanese in genetics and in physical appearance. So, is the race Burakumin real?

                        <p>Reeve (2015) "Young's eye was almond shaped, flat, and the lid partially closed, a shape and narrow opening most comparable to that of a hog. For Simms it was clear and physical evidence of Young's 'disposition to love many.' [...] Her eyes were large and round with a wide vertical opening, similar to the eye of a dove—a bird that mates for life (see figure 1.2). Simms thus concluded, 'In the range of Physiognomy everything partakes of a lower nature when built upon the wide and low form.' The almond-shaped eyes with their 'less vertical measurement' produced an 'exhibition of love' that was 'more bestial in its nature, and has little in common with Monoeroticity, which is pure and angelic in its tone.'"</p>

                        ## Race and Social Construction

                        - What does it mean that race is a socially constructed concept? 
                        - The boundaries between the racial groups change over time.
                        - Traits in physical appearance may not always be the marker of a racial group.
                        - Race is real with real social consequences: The dominant group receives social or economic advantages while the oppressed group are worse off!
                        - Race is a social construction, that is that people in the same society share a common understanding about their relationship on the basis of some assumptions about reality.
