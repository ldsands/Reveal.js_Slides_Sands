                            ## Tragedy of the Commons

                            - The tragedy of the commons is a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, <span style="color: red">acting independently</span> according to their own <span style="color: red">self-interest</span>, behave contrary to the <span style="color: red">common good</span> of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their collective action.

                            - Private Good(s): a good that is <span style="color: red">excludable</span> (access can be denied)
                                - i.e. owners can exercise private property rights, preventing those who have not paid for it from using the good or consuming its benefits
                                - Examples: Smart phones, university parking lot
                            - Public Good(s) (or the commons): a good that is both <span style="color: red">non-excludable</span> in that individuals cannot be excluded from use or could be enjoyed without paying for it. ([from Wikipeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons))
                                - Examples: clean air, quietness in the night, atmosphere, oceans, rivers, ocean fish stocks, or even an office refrigerator

                        ## Tragedy of the Commons

                        - Unregulated grazing on common land in Great Britain and Ireland -- William Forster Lloyd (1833) 
                        - "Tragedy of the commons" - [Garrett Hardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hardin) (1968)
                        - Governing the Commons - [Elinor Ostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom) (1990)
                            - Who has rights to access and use resources?
                            - How much of the resources can be withdrawn?
                            - Who will monitor whether the resource is being used according to the set of rules?
                            - How to punish those who break the rules?
                            - Who will decide what the rules are?
                            - What to do in case of a disagreement?
                        - Rather than privatization of the common resources, or controlled and monitored by the State, people can often self-organize themselves in order to successfully manage their resources by *creating a whole system of social institutions*.

                        ## Hardin's Theory vs Ostrom's Findings

                        - Hardin's theory:
                            - If each herdsman sharing a piece of common grazing land made the individually rational economic decision of increasing the number of cattle he keeps on the land, the collective effect would deplete or destroy the commons
                        - Elinor Ostrom's findings:
                            - She spent time with traditional communities whose life and economy largely dependent on a natural resource base
                            - Switzerland and Japan (mountain meadows), Spain and Philippines (Irrigation system); Nepal (forest); Indonesia (Fisheries)
                            - Ostrom finds that each of these communities have developed their own set of rules for determining how to use their natural resources
                            - Disproved Hardin's theory by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources

                        ## Example: Fracking

                        - Hydraulic fracturing 
                            - Fracking is the process of drilling down into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside.
                            - Water, sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well.
                            - The process can be carried out vertically or, more commonly, by drilling horizontally to the rock layer, which can create new pathways to release gas or used to extend existing channels.

                            ## Fracking in Pennsylvania
                            
                            - The front lines of America's "energy revolution"
                            - Rural, heavily reliant on coal and timber
                            - What is different from coal and timber is that fracking companies need to lease the right of land from the landowners and operate right in the lessor's backyards
                                - Dependent on personal approval from individual residents
                                - More direct financial benefits
                                - No townhall debates or referenda about whether the community should allow drilling

                            <a href="https://www.fractracker.org/2020/01/fracking-in-pennsylvania-in-2019/">

                        ## The Dilemma of Fracking in Pennsylvania

                        - The lease decision is made by each of the households
                        - But the consequences have an impact on almost everyone — even if they do not host natural gas infrastructure on their property or receive lease bonuses or royalties
                        - Even drilling a well one mile away
                            - You can feel the vibration (especially at night)
                            - Lots of "noise, [...] light pollution, and the smells"
                            - No control over the intrusion of these forms of pollution onto one's property
                        - Tragedy of the commons!

                        ## Negative Externalities of Environmental Problems

                        - **Negative Externalities**: a negative side-effect of an activity that affects other people
                        - Market efficiency depends on prices reflecting the true costs of producing things, but firms often systematically displace costs and risks on others in many ways
                        - Example: a paper mill
                            - Not incredibly sophisticated
                            - Cost includes vegetable fibres, electricity, water, human resources
                            - The paper factory's best financial interest is to dump the waste directly into a river
                            - It is expensive to process the waste
                            - Inland Empire Paper Company in Millwood, WA (just up the river from where I grew up)
                            - This is the exact problem of NE, the cost of processing the wastes now is displaced on those living near by the river, those farmers, and residents. There are quite many social problems that involve NE, especially environmental problems; and later we will have in-depth discussion about NE displaced on racial minority communities. 
                            - Who can stop NE? Either government or collective actions by community.

                        ## A Special Case of Negative Externalities: NIMBY

                        - NIMBY: **Not In My BackYard**
                        - Displacing costs onto the vulnerable groups
                            - Radioactive waste dumps
                            - Halfway houses for the mentally ill
                            - Fertilizer plants
                            - Cancer causing air pollution [ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/toxmap/)
                                - "In predominantly Black census tracts, the estimated cancer risk from toxic air pollution is more than double that of majority-white tracts." [ProPublica "Sacrifice Zones"](https://www.propublica.org/article/toxmap-poison-in-the-air)
                            - Power is key to shifting negative externalities onto others
                                - Corporations do their best to displace costs onto others
                                - Affluent communities are better able to organize collective actions to block such displacement of cost
                        - More examples:
                            - Nitrogen fertilizer and farming
                            - Acid rain
                            - Amazon rainforest burning
                            - Love Canal in New York

                        ## Love Canal

                        - Love Canal is an aborted canal project branching off of the Niagara River
                        - In 1950s, the Hooker Chemical began using the partially dug canal as a chemical waste dump, around 21,000 tons of toxic chemicals
                        - Hooker capped the 16-acre hazardous waste landfill in clay and sold the land to a School Board
                        - A series of inexplicable illnesses
                        - President Jimmy Carter declared a state of emergency in 1978
                        - Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) in 1980
                            - Known as the Superfund
                            - Holds responsible parties liable or when no viable party responsible
                                - Charges chemical companies to help clean up hazardous waste
                            - How might Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024) and Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce (2024) impact this?

                            ## Exxon Valdez

                            - March 24, 1989
                            - Tanker off the coast of Alaska hit rocks
                                - Used Captain as scapegoat
                                    - Journalist Greg Palast stated in 2008:
                                    - "Forget the drunken skipper fable. As to Captain Joe Hazelwood, he was below decks, sleeping off his bender. At the helm, the third mate may never have collided with Bligh Reef had he looked at his RAYCAS radar. But the radar was not turned on. In fact, the tanker's radar was left broken and disabled for more than a year before the disaster, and Exxon management knew it. It was just too expensive to fix and operate."
                                    - Fought the implementation of double hulls and more
                                - Employed the local fishermen to clean up the mess but many got incredibly sick from the cleanup
                                - Initially charged over $5 Billion in damages (actual and punitive)
                                    - Supreme Court Decision Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker 2008
                                        - "The real problem is the stark unpredictability of punitive awards. Courts are concerned with fairness as consistency, and the available data suggest that the spread between high and low individual awards is unacceptable."
                                        - "In this context, the unpredictability of high punitive awards is in tension with their punitive function because of the implication of unfairness that an eccentrically high punitive verdict carries."
