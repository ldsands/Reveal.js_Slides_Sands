                        ## Application Assignment 01

                        - Part 1 is comparatively easy
                        - For part 2 I'm looking for you to use sources and/or your own creativity to discuss policies their possible benefits, downsides, difficulties with implementation etc.
                            - Now reflect on how these "known unknowns" of financial life might reinforce class stratification. Narrate a realistic scenario of events that might transpire in that worst-case scenario. What policies or programs might we have to avoid vicious circles of poverty or financial rabbit holes—without creating incentives that could backfire (i.e., inadvertently cause people not to save any money themselves)?
                        - Try to incorporate course concepts and/or terms correctly into your response
                        - Put yourself in the shoes of someone who is at risk of falling below the poverty line or who already is in poverty as you answer part 2
                        - Citations particularly those from academic sources will likely help your grades

                        ## Social Reproduction of Inequality

                        - **Social Reproduction of Inequality**: The basic idea is that social positions (e.g., social class, occupations, education, etc.) tend to pass on from one generation to another
                        - **Social Institution**: institutions are social structures that have rules, norms and boundaries that influence the behavior of individuals.
                            - Examples: Families, religion, government, schools, healthcare etc.
                        - **Social Capital**: connections to people who have resources you can access
                            - Examples: law or health expertise (doctors, lawyers), job prospects
                        - **Cultural Capital**: class based knowledge and preferences used to signal your class to others
                            - Examples: Opera (RBG), SNL Colbert etc., cars, etc.
                        - **Social Closure**: group boundaries and identities that prevent others from using group resources
                            - Examples: Country clubs, LDS humanitarian aid, Federalist Society etc.

                        ## Structural Causes of Poverty

                        - From prior classes: **Neoliberalism**, **Automation**, **Globalization**
                        - **Deindustrialization**: "the transition from a predominantly goods producing economy to one based on the provision of services" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                        - **Unions**: Unions are organizations that bring employees together collectively to fight for better wages, benefits, and worker protections

                        - National Labor Relations Act (1935) made it illegal for companies to engage in some activities that prevented collective bargaining
                            - Undermined by Supreme Court, State Legislatures and Congress over the years - Taft-Heartly Act (1947) and Right-To-Work state statutes, Janus v. AFSCME (2018) for public sector unions
                        - **Collective bargaining** - negotiation between employees and groups of employees
                            - Goal is to reach contracts
                            - Unions can use strikes or threat of strikes to increase negotiating power when in talks with employer

                        ## Co-Determination

                        - "[I]nvolves the right of workers to participate in management of the companies they work for." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codetermination_in_Germany))
                            - McGaughey, Ewan, The Codetermination Bargains: The History of German Corporate and Labour Law (March 25, 2015)
                        - Stakeholders differences and long-term vs short-term goals
                        - managers, boards, shareholders, and workers
                        - Shareholders want short-term investment returns
                            - Stock buy backs - "when a public company uses cash to buy shares of its own stock on the open market." ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/stock-buyback/)) Illegal from 1934-1982 ([Vox](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/2/17639762/stock-buybacks-tax-cuts-trump-republicans))
                            - Dividends - "payment in cash or stock that public companies distribute to their shareholders." ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-dividend/))
                            - This money cannot then be re-invested into the company and employees
                                - e.g. R&D, bonuses, wage increases etc. ([Curbing Stock Buybacks - RI](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/curbing-stock-buybacks-crucial-step-raising-worker-pay-reduce-inequality/))
                            - Employees want long-term stability
                            - "Enshittification (alternately, crapification and platform decay) is a pattern in which online products and services decline in quality. Initially, vendors create high-quality offerings to attract users, then they degrade those offerings to better serve business customers, and finally degrade their services to users and business customers to maximize profits for shareholders."
