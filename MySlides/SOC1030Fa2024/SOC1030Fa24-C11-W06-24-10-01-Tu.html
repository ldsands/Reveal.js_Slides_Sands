                        ## Race VS Ethnicity (Review)

                        - Race is a:
                            - Classification system of human beings that is
                            - Socially created (“socially constructed”)
                            - Typically, but not always, race is connected to visible attributes (skin color, physical characteristics, etc.)
                        - Ethnicity is one's ethnic quality or affiliation. It is voluntary, self-defined, non-hierarchical, fluid and multiple, and based on cultural differences, not physical ones.

                        ## Racially Discriminatory Laws and Policies

                        ## Jim Crow Laws

                        - **Jim Crow Laws** were a collection of state and local statutes that legalized and enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
                            - [Black Americans could not be legal citizens until passage of the 14th Amendment to Constitution in 1868](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xiv)
                            - **The Vagrancy Laws**: laws that were designed to criminalize anyone who didn't have a job, in the reconstruction south this left enormous discretion to police and reinforced sharecropping
                                - "And then there was the poll tax, which all eleven states of the former  Confederacy had adopted. Initially, after the Civil War, the poll tax “was  intended not so much to disenfranchise the Negro as to place him again  under the white man's domination, since failure to pay the tax was made  prima facie evidence of vagrancy,” which was the catchall term to  criminalize, jail, and auction off African Americans. The “Negro who  desired to stay off the chain gang was ... forced to place himself under the  protection of a white man who would pay the tax for him." (Anderson and Durbin 2018)
                            - **One Drop Rule**: a black is any person with any known African black ancestry
                        - Jim Crow laws were upheld in 1896 in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, in which the U.S. Supreme Court laid out its "separate but equal" legal doctrine for facilities for African Americans.

                        ## The Civil Rights Movement ended Jim Crow Laws

                        - In 1948 President Harry Truman ordered integration in the military
                        - In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that educational segregation was unconstitutional, bringing to an end to the era of "separate-but-equal" education
                        - In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, which legally ended the segregation that had been institutionalized by Jim Crow laws
                        - And in 1965, the Voting Rights Act outlawed racially discriminatory voting restrictions
                        - The Fair Housing Act of 1968 ended discrimination in renting and selling homes.

                        ## Some Examples of Resistance to Integration

                        - **Segregation Academies** - Private schools in the suburbs to avoid integration (McGhee 2022)
                            - These private schools were often explicitly created by religious organizations to maintain segregation in schools (Maney 2024)
                            - There are still around 300 of these schools still operating in the South (Maney 2024)
                            - States allocated a lot of funding to these new private schools often at the expense of the public schools (now mostly serving black students) (Maney 2024)
                        - Pool Example (McGhee 2022)
                        - **Redlining** (discussed in later slides)

                        ## Housing Discrimination and Redlining

                        - In 1934, as a part of the New Deal, Congress passed the National Housing Act, and established the Federal Housing Administration.
                        - To make sure loans are not to be defaulted, **Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC)** created "residential security maps."
                            - Financial institutions gave out loans on the basis of areas on these security maps. (from top down)
                            - Through restrictive covenants, newly formed suburban areas refused to sell houses to families from racial minority. (from bottom up)
                            - From 1934-1968, more than 98% of home loans were given to white families. 
                            - **Redlining**: the use of these maps that created zones that were bad investments (based on race)

                        ## Impact of Housing Segregation

                        - Housing segregation and discrimination fundamentally shape the lives of people
                        - Unequal distribution of wealth between Whites and Blacks
                        - Housing segregation in schools
                            - Jim Crow laws of school segregation was formally ended in 1960s, but the segregation between whites and blacks continued in the recent decades
                        - Health outcomes
                        - Racial profiling in policing (spatial profiling in policing)

                        ## Gentrification

                        - **Gentrification**: A process of neighborhood change that includes economic change in a **historically disinvested neighborhood** -  by means of real estate investment and new higher-income residents moving in
                        - In economic terms, it means the value and cost of neighborhood housing and property is higher. 
                        - Gentrification accompanies the influx of middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating areas that often displaces poorer residents. 
                        - Displacement of inner city poor, who are mostly racial minority

                        ## Gentrification

                        - Why does Gentrification Happen?
                            - Reason #1: The local government usually welcomes development because investment generates taxes
                            - Reason #2: Many young professionals who once moved to the suburbs now hope to stay closer to the urban core
                            - Reason #3: American society and its economic culture encourage change
                        - Is gentrification a social problem? Who is to blame?

                        ## Gentrification

                        - Positive:
                            - Visible beautification efforts
                            - Estate investment and increased municipal revenue
                            - An outcome of capitalism of housing market
                        - Negative:
                            - The areas that are gentrified are mostly areas with majority of the residents being racial minority, with low property values
                            - Displacement of inner city poor, who are mostly racial minority (and where are they displaced?)
                            - No particular person or organization are to blame
                            - Can often disrupt minorities with vibrant communities

                        ## Implications of Race

                        - Despite being socially constructed race has real and often massive implications on

                        ## Crime Stress and Leaning

                        - Crime means more stress and that impacts learning
                        - "[T]his study exploits variation in violent crime rates within schools over time to estimate its effect on academic achievement. School and neighborhood fixed-effects models show that violent crime rates have a negative effect on test scores, but not on grades. This effect is more likely related to direct reductions in learning, through cognitive stress and classroom disruptions, than changes in perceived safety, general school climate, or discipline practices." (Burdick-Will 2013)

                        ## What is Critical Race Theory (CRT)

                        - Came from legal studies
                        - Focused on outcomes
                        - These different outcomes are not always driven by explicit racism
                        - Racist outcomes can result from institutional, social and cultural dynamics (and more)
                        - Prof. Victor Ray teaches Critical Race Theory and Race, Organizations, and Workplace courses
                            - "Racism is America's central political fault line. Critical race theory shows how this fault line runs through the American legal system." (Ray 2022)

                        ## Group Activity

                        - Read [The Inequality Hidden Within the Race-Neutral GI Bill by Shannon Luders-Manuel](https://daily.jstor.org/the-inequality-hidden-within-the-race-neutral-g-i-bill/)
                            - Discuss how the GI bill could impact generations of families
                        - Explore the graphs found on the NYT article “Money, Race and Success: How Your School District Compares”
                        - Discuss concepts from class and how they relate to the data presented in the article
                        - Go to [https://nytimesineducation.com/access-nyt/](https://nytimesineducation.com/access-nyt/) search for U of I
                        - Go to [https://oese.ed.gov/ppe/](https://oese.ed.gov/ppe/) and look up the racial dot map (arcgis)
                            - Compare school expenditure per student for high schools from different districts with different racial makeups (e.g. Park City vs Salt Lake City)
                            - How does race impact funding? How might that translate to other parts of life?
