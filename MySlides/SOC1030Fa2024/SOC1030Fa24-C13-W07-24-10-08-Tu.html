                        - **Social deviance**: any transgression of socially established norms
                        - **Crime**: an intentional act that violates the criminal law, and penalized by the state

                        ## Changing Boundaries

                        - Construction of criminal offenders
                            - Criminal offenders are not always or very "different" from ourselves
                            - Society creates an "outsider" view of "criminals"
                        - Construction of criminal offenses
                            - Varying boundary between social deviance and crime
                            - Some behaviors are criminal & obviously "bad" other behaviors may be considered "bad" but not criminal & still other behaviors are criminal but not necessarily "bad"!

                        ## Social cohesion

                        - Functionalist view: Emile Durkheim: Worried about society breaking down since not everyone was on farms anymore thus had different values, experiences, beliefs etc.
                        - **Social cohesion**: the extent to which society holds together without dissolving into conflict.
                            - Can think of this as how much trust there is in a group or having common goals, values etc.
                        - **Collective conscience**: the common faith or set of social norms by which a society and its members abide
                            - Examples: Sports teams - [What are some rituals that relate to sports?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi_HiInBipc)
                        - Religions and political parities are good examples of both
                        - What are some groups that you think would have high social cohesion or have a collective conscience?

                        ## Types of Solidarity

                        - **Mechanical solidarity**: social cohesion is based on sameness (same values, beliefs, behaviors) -- agrarian society
                            - Likely to get along with those like you
                            - Example: you'll get along with those with the same or similar identities as you
                        - **Organic solidarity**: social cohesion is based on difference and interdependence of the parts -- industrialized society
                            - Likely to get along with those who you depend on or who depend on you
                            - Example: you'll get along with your doctor, your kids' teachers etc.

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Solidarity and Justice

                        - Associated with Mechanical solidarity: **Punitive justice**: makes the offender suffer and thus defining the boundaries of acceptable behavior, and unite the collectivity through punishment such as hanging, stoning, public shaming, etc.
                            - Example: UN parking tickets from countries with intensive kinship narrow circle of trust, for them intent doesn't matter - The WEIRDest People in the World (Henrich 2020)
                        - Associated with Organic solidarity: **Rehabilitative justice**: Rehabilitative responses are tailored to individual perpetrator, because of the varying circumstances and conditions.
                            - Example: Think Boeing and all the issues with them, very few have been indicted for what they did with the 737 MAX

                        ## Labeling theory
                        
                        - A symbolic interactionist approach to social deviance
                        - **Labeling theory**: the belief that individuals subconsciously notice how others see or label them, and their reactions to those labels over time form the basis of their self-identity
                        - Labeling theory argues that it is through the social process of labeling that we create deviance by assigning **shared meanings** to acts
                            - **Shared meanings**: the common understandings that are socially constructed that are attached to some action, symbol, concept etc.
                        - "Culture [or social boundaries] is actually 'enforced' through the **social sanctions** applied to those who violate **social norms**" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Labeling theory

                        - Example: think about Jane Elliott and her blue eye, brown eye experiment
                        - Example: when diagnosed with a mental illness/disorder, to prevent change to self-concept patients engage in coping behaviors in the study they examine how some factors predict which coping methods the patients will use (Kroska and Harkness 2011)
