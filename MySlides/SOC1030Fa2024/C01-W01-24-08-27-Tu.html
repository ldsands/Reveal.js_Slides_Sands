                        ## Terminology Disclaimer

                        - Despite our data likely consisting only of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints we will use the terms Mormon/Mormonism as they are the terms used by the authors and are common in the academic literature and as a way to acknowledge the broader Latter-day Saint movement. For similar reasons, we will also use the term LDS Church.

                        ## Disaffiliation and Mixed-Faith Marriages

                        - The religious nones have increased from 5.1% in 1972 to 23.7% in 2018 (Burge 2021)
                            - Most of this increase is because to religious disaffiliation
                        - Societal factors are contributing to the acceleration of disaffiliation (Thiessen and Wilkins-Laflamme 2017)
                        - The LDS church's disaffiliation rates have been accelerating (Cragun, Gull, and Phillips 2023)
                        - Disaffiliation is a difficult event (Knight et al. 2019)
                            - Many who disaffiliate experience "grief, emotional distress, and even posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms"
                            - All members of families experience relational distress during disaffiliation
                        - Those in a mixed-faith marriage are more likely to disaffiliate (Sandomirsky and Wilson 1990)

                        ## Impact of Religious Disaffiliation on Marriage

                        - There has been some research that suggests that mixed-faith marriages experience increases in conflict (Knight et al. 2019; McCarthy 2007)
                        - Little research has been done on this increase in conflict despite the rising number of mixed-faith marriages (Knight et al. 2019; McCarthy 2007)
                        - With this research, we hope to explore how couples navigate the challenges of mixed-faith marriages

Title: Marital Cold War: How Exmormons Navigate Mixed-Faith Marriages After Disaffiliation
Abstract: (max 250 words)

Secularization and disaffiliation has accelerated in the US. This has led to an increasing number of mixed-faith marriages or marriages in which one spouse exits religion altogether. These marriages and their impacts have received little attention from sociologists.

We use over 800 posts made by 54 authors on r/exmormon, a subreddit a topic-based forum on the social media website Reddit.com. This subreddit is where exmormons or those who have disaffiliated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints discuss topics related to their disaffiliation. Due to the richness of the data we are able to incorporate many variables about the demographics and circumstances of the authors and follow their updates on their marriage over several years. We then use grounded theory to analyze the posts.

In our presentation, we will present our grounded theory analysis of the different circumstances of the authors, how they talk about their marriages and the changes we see over time. We will also discuss how the authors see their marriages and how they cope with the challenges presented by their mixed-faith marriages. We will also present the authors' reporting of the impacts of their mixed-faith marriage on themselves and their families.

                        ## Data

                        - Reddit is a social media site that hosts communities/forums called subreddits
                        - All data was collected from the submissions (posts) from r/exmormon
                            - Has almost 300,000 subscribers (as of today)
                            - 149,879 unique authors (June 2021)
                            - 8,646,410 total submissions and comments (June 2021)
                        - Submissions are from 2010-07 to 2023-03
                        - Submissions were filtered using Regular Expressions using the following string
                            - "mixed faith|mixed-faith|TBM husband|TBM hubby|TBM wife|TBM spouse|TBM partner|believing husband|believing wife|believing spouse|believing partner"
                        - Each unique author has to have at least 10 posts that were included in the list of filtered posts
                            - 53 Authors, 41 men, 12 women
                            - 818 posts
                            - Dropped two authors due to all their posts being meetup related
                        - We purposely limited our initial filter to allow for a more manageable amount of data for this initial study
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Methods

                        - We coded for several quantitative variables. For example, do they live in the Mormon Corridor, did the couple have children, did they get a divorce, does the believing spouse also disaffiliate, etc.
                        - We also used a grounded theory approach to construct a theory that explains our observations of the data (Charmaz 2014)
                            - We will focus on the process of changing behaviors in this presentation

                        ## Results

                        - The most common themes we found fell into two catagories:
                            - the impact of the subreddit post authors (authors) change in beliefs
                            - the impact of authors change in behaviors
                        - These changes where frequently the topic of discussion for the authors
                        - These discussions prompted us to develop a path diagram illustrating how disaffiliates change their beliefs (internal) and behaviors (external)
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Internal Changes

                        - This is not our primary focus at this point, but the disaffiliation process is for many a long process of reevaluating beliefs
                        - Internal changes are the changes in beliefs that those who disaffiliate undergo throughout their process of disaffiliation
                        - Just the act of posting to r/exmormon indicates that the author is likely at the end of or past their major change in beliefs
                        - Most of our sample only discussed changes in beliefs in the past tense

                        ## External Changes - Rejection

                        - External changes are what we are calling changes in behavior and or language
                        - In the diagram, the rejection or acceptance of external changes can be anticipatory, an actual interaction or a combination of both
                        - The example below illustrates probable rejection
                        > [...] I want more out of life. I want to travel, I want to do stuff, I want to have some goddamned alcohol and relax. [...] But I can't. I can't "rock" the boat. I have to pretend all is well in zion. I love my wife and my kids. I don't want to bail. [...] Any time I feel like speaking up for myself, say "I want to go for coffee" I back down, I can't stand the hurt looks I get. [...]

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## External Changes - Rejection

                        - When rejection occurs, several themes emerged from the posts
                        - Avoidance (as seen in the previous example) - avoiding changes in behaviors or even discussing them was commonly expressed
                        - Awkward interactions - interactions where norms dictate certain behaviors or language are triggers for awkward moments when the author doesn't conform
                        > [...] My young family and I just moved overseas. We are getting adjusted to our new life. The LDS network has its advantages in helping new people find a group of like minded individuals [...] In the two weeks she's gone to church our family has been invited both weeks to have dinner at a ward members house. [...] she's welcome to go but I'm not interested in joining her. [...] generally I find these types of social interactions as awkward and exhausting. [...] I don't care to endure their questioning of why I don't believe or their gazes as they try to figure out what sins are keeping me from seeing the truth. [...]
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## External Changes - Rejection

                        - Conflict - disagreements are triggered over changes in behaviors or expectations
                        - In this example, the father wants to forgo an important Mormon coming of age ceremony
                            - TBM - True Believing Mormon, or someone who is "all in" or unwilling or unable to question the church
                        > Son starting priesthood interviews - This caused a big blow up fight with my TBM wife at first, because when she asked if I even wanted son getting priesthood, I answered “of course not!” [...]
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## External Changes - Rejection

                        - Emotional pain - Most of the posts that mention some form of extreme emotional pain was experienced by the author, but it was not uncommon for the pain to be experienced by the spouse or by both partners
                        - This emotional pain is experienced as depression, anxiety, grief/sadness/hopelessness, suicidal ideation, etc.
                        > [...] So this weekend was the WORST of my entire life. I've been mentally out for 2-3 weeks, been slowly dropping hints to my DW about my doubts, trying to not rock the boat, etc. [...] My DW and I were talking Saturday night and she showed me some Jeff Holland meme [...] I broke down, I couldn't take it anymore, so the flood gates opened, all my doubts/concerns came out, told her about the CES letter and my issues with Racism, the BOA, blood atonement, the BOM inconsistencies and anachronisms, etc. etc. etc. [...]  Not the way I wanted to go about it, it was a mistake, but now it was done. Major cry fest all around, wife is mad at me, blames me, says that everything I feel about the Church, she now feels about me. It was a really tough night. She is now having major anxiety and depression, and worries about the future. [...]

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## External Changes - Rejection

                        - Inauthenticity - Many of the authors continue participating in the church (sometimes PIMOs) despite feelings of inauthenticity
                        - In this example, the author continued with a calling (volunteer church position) for "a while" before resigning
                        > Bishop wants to extend me a calling. I go full apostate. [...] The calling I have in mind is humanitarian in nature. I can't see how your integrity would be compromised. May I discuss it w you tonight? [...] I have no doubt that the humanitarian calling you have in mind for me is a worthy endeavor. But it would compromise my integrity to represent a church who refuses to denounce that Joseph Smith had sexual relations with multiple teenagers [...]

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## External Changes - Acceptance

                        - Relief - When a change in behavior occurs and the spouse is accepting, there is frequently an expression of relief
                        - In this example the author is relieved because her husband encourages her to stop attending church
                        > [...] I put on a dress and went to sacrament meeting. I didn't realize how triggered I was until I broke down in tears tonight. I can't do it. I just cannot do it anymore. [...] He agreed that it would be better for me to skip church from now on. [...] I feel relieved, yet awful. I know going to church with him isn't the only way I can show him love and support, but somehow I tied that together in my mind. [...] Mixed faith marriage. 0/10 stars. Would not recommend.
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## External Changes - Acceptance

                        - Hope - When spouses agree to some behavior change (often sharing some information) the author frequently expresses hope that their spouse will change
                        - In this example the author is hopeful that her husband might change his beliefs
                        > TBM husband is agreeing to read "Rough Stone Rolling" with me. Should I have any hope? [...] He's a head-in-the-sand hardcore TBM and he won't take a glance at any sources or evidence I give him that isn't from FAIR or directly from the church (because having sources accompanied immediately by apologist interpretation makes him more comfortable.)
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Outside influences

                        - Outside influences - Pro-Mormon - Since many of the authors come to r/exmormon to describe challenges they have experienced many posts relate the influence of church members, leaders or other church sources on their spouse's willingness to allow the author to change behaviors
                        - In this example the author points to an example of church members belittling anyone who leaves the faith
                        > TBM hubby had sacrament meeting on while we cooked; I need to purge my disgust. [...] One speaker talked about ward unity, at one point lamenting people losing their faith—me and whoever else wised up thanks to covid I guess. [...] I’m just sick of being characterized by the church as having LOST something. Like, what a failure on my part to be so clumsy and stupid to have gone about losing my faith, tisk tisk. Is it too hard to comprehend we leave because we’ve GAINED something? Like, I dunno, maybe KNOWLEDGE that the CHURCH IS FALSE??? [...]
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Outside influences

                        - Outside influences - Pro-Disaffiliation - Some influences are not friendly to the church such as interactions with others on r/exmormon or other non-church related individuals or sources
                        - In this example the author asks for podcast recommendations and after receiving feedback updates the post
                        > Podcast suggestions? [...] UPDATE; thank you all for your suggestions. I felt (prompted) to start with a [Y]ear of [P]olygamy.. I’ve binged it all night [...]

                        ## Discussion

                        - Mixed-faith marriages are increasing and they experience increased conflict (Knight et al. 2019; McCarthy 2007)
                        - With our data we have proposed a model that helps to explain not only conflict but other outcomes associated with mixed-faith marriages
                        - Limitations and future research
                            - This model could be confirmed with mixed-faith marriages from other sects
                            - This model could also be integrated with other models of disaffiliation
                            - Obtaining a representative sample for possible generalization of the findings
