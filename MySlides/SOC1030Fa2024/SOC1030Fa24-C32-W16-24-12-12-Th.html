                    ## Strain Theory of the American Dream

                    - Robert Merton's **Strain Theory of Deviance**: The American Dream causes stress that pushes people to deviate
                        - Strain occurs because most people want to be rich and successful but relatively few can be
                    - Strain produces four kinds of deviant people:
                        - **Ritualists** who unhappily do their legitimate jobs but no longer believe it serves any useful purpose
                        - **Retreatists** who drop out of society (hippies of the 1960s for example, "turn on, tune in, drop out")
                        - **Rebels** who seek to bring down society (terrorist bombers for example)

                    - Lori Arnold and Roland Jarvis (her husband) are Innovators in their pursuit of the American Dream

                    ## Drug Controversies and Demonization

                    - **Moral Panic**: "Heightened fear and concern, misplaced anxiety, a reviled agent responsible for conditions less harmful than we think" (Goode and Ben-Yehuda 2009)
                    - The social construction of drug "epidemics" (Mosher and Akins 2014)
                        - Are all drug "epidemics" dangerous or are some moral panics?
                    - Marijuana
                        - 1800s to around 1930 mostly portrayed as benign especially when compared with alcohol
                        - The Federal Bureau of Narcotics (now the DEA) "initiated a vigorous anti-marijuana propaganda campaign" (Mosher and Akins 2014)
                            - Included movies (Marijuana Girl, Refer Madness)
                        - The backlash to marijuana was a direct result to the increasing Mexican immigration
                            > From 1900 to 1934 (just prior to the passage of  the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937), most articles on the topic asserted that the primary users of marijuana were members of minority groups—in particular, Mexicans. For example, one commentator from Sacramento, California, noted, “marijuana, perhaps now the most insidious of narcotics, is a direct by-product of Mexican immigration. . . . Mexican peddlers have been caught distributing sample marijuana cigarettes to schoolchildren” (cited in Musto, 1999, p. 220)

                        ## Marijuana Demonization

                        - Starting in the 1960s media started to acknowledge that prior information about the dangers of marijuana had been exaggerated
                            - This led to some relaxing of some restrictions
                            - This largely continued into the 1990s
                        - In the 2000s there was a renewed push to demonize marijuana (driven by the Bush administration)
                            - More research came out refuting the demonization
                        > Considering the scientific research assessing the gateway drug hypothesis as a whole, it is safe to say that  there is no pharmacological basis for this theory. However, as noted above, there may be a relationship  between marijuana use and the use of other drugs that is due to the fact that marijuana must be purchased in  illicit markets.

                    ## Other drug "Epidemics"

                    ## Which Drugs Are the Worst?
                
                    - In your groups discuss this maybe do a bit of searching
                    - Come up with a list of drugs in order of harm

                    ## Relative Harm Ratings of Different Drugs

                    - In 2010, the United Kingdom's  Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, a panel of world drug experts on the various harms that drugs  can cause to users, to others, and to society, published its report.
                    - Harmfulness of Drugs on a 100-Point Scale
                        - Alcohol 72 
                        - New Opioids?
                        - Heroin 55
                        - Crack 54
                        - Meth 33
                        - Cocaine 27
                        - Tobacco 26

                        - LSD 7
                        - Mushrooms 6
                    - 2010 was before the current opioid crisis.

                    ## Successful Treatment for Addiction: Try, Try Again

                    - Schachter's Research on quitting smoking (Sghachter 1982)
                    - Success rates for drug abuse patients during their second and third treatments remain above 20%. For example:
                        - Tx 1: Out of 100 drug users, 30 become clean and sober.
                        - Tx 2: Out of 70 drug users, 18 become clean and sober.
                        - Tx 3: Out of 52 drug users, 10 become clean and sober.
                        - Total Success Rate after 3 Courses of Treatment: 58%

                    ## Drug Decriminalization in Oregon

                    - Drug Addiction Treatment and Recovery Act (Measure 110)
                        - Decriminalized passed in late 2020
                    - ["decriminalization policies do not lead to increases in overdose deaths"](https://www.opb.org/article/2023/09/27/oregon-drug-decriminalization-measure-110-overdose-deaths/)
                        - They did go up but not more than other states over the same time period (the increases are due to fentanyl)
                        - Similar findings have been replicated (Zoorob et al. 2024)
                        - This is still being researched
                    - Some suggest that there have been increased homelessness and crime but some early research suggests that isn't the case
                    - It is really too early to know much about the impacts

                        ## The Opioid Crisis and Purdue Pharma

                        - Purdue Pharma drove the opioid crisis
                            - They knew that their product was extremely addictive
                            - They also knew that people were abusing their drug
