                    ## Sociology and Network Science

                    - Sociological Origins of Network Science
                        - Early theory by Georg Simmel and Emile Durkheim
                        - Some work done with operationalization in the 30s and 50s
                        - In the 1970s developed into a science by Mark Granovetter and several others
                        - Today some (relatively) famous Sociologists (Duncan J. Watts and Nicholas A. Christakis) have gone further with computation and network analysis
                    - Freda Lynn - Sociology of Networks SOC:3880
                        - Only requires SOC:1010 or SOC:1030
                        - Also teaches Capstone and Methods course for undergrads
                    - Yongren Shi - Data Science for Social Good
                        - Also teaches this course
                    - Both Dr. Lynn and Dr. Shi actively use network methods in their research
                    - Dr. Shi and I have done some network science with Reddit (r/incels) using network methods

                    ## Social Networks (Network Science)

                    - **Nodes**: the distinct element or actor
                        - The "dots" in network graphs
                    - **Ties or Edges**: the connections between nodes
                        - The lines connecting nodes
                    - **Hubs**: Nodes with a high degree
                        - Users with many ties (friends) also called bridging ties
                        - Nicholas A. Christakis and sickness on campus
                    - **Small-World**: "Easy" to get from any node to every other node in the network
                        - The average degree of separation between 2 random nodes was 4.7
                            - Source: The Anatomy of the Facebook Social Graph
                    - **Clustering**: to what degree the network is sorted into clusters
                        - Facebook high clustering due to recommendation algorithm
                        - How are clustering and social closure related?
                    - **Homophily**: to what extent the ties are between nodes that are similar to each other
                        - Example: "Mormonverse" on Reddit: automatic banned on r/lds if user has ever posted on r/exmormon

                    - Is this network highly clustered?
                    - What differentiates each cluster from each other?
                    - Imagine that each of these clusters are workers in different departments.
                        - Which cluster would you prefer to be in a work setting?
                        - Which cluster would you prefer to be in when there is a viral outbreak.

                    ## Example Uses of Network Science

                    - Those with a higher degree where more likely to get sick first (Christakis and Fowler 2010)
                        - [Video of the spread of the Flu](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012948#s5)
                    - Academic publishing patterns (e.g. Biology publications have a much higher number of authors) [(Newman 2004)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0307545100)
                    - The religiosity of the ties to the respondent impacts the depressive episodes of the respondent [(Upenieks 2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jssr.12668)
                        - If the respondent is religious the more religious their ties the fewer depressive episodes they'll have
                        - If the respondent isn't religious the more religious their ties the more depressive episodes they'll have
                    - Quality of the ties in a network is tied to well being [(Offer 2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022146520952767)
                        - "Having a non-difficult partner is associated with lower loneliness compared to having no partner, but having no partner and having a difficult partner are related to similar levels of loneliness. Likewise, having difficult adult children and having no adult children are associated with reporting greater psychological distress than having nondifficult adult children."

                    ## Polarization

                    - **Issue-Based Sorting**: "Democrats hold liberal issue positions and Republicans hold conservative issue positions." (Mason 2018)
                    - **Issue-Based Polarization**: "[...] is closer to the traditional understanding of the term polarization, and indicates an increasing distance between the average issue positions of Democrats and Republicans." (Mason 2018)
                    - **Social Sorting**: "increasing social homogeneity within each party, such that religious, racial, and ideological divides tend to line up along partisan lines." (Mason 2018)
                        - Democrats are increasingly irreligious, a member of a minority racial group, and liberal
                        - Republicans are increasingly religious, white (the most numerous racial group), and conservative
                    - **Social Polarization**: "[...] defined by prejudice, anger, and activism on behalf of that prejudice and anger." (Mason 2018)
                        - "American partisans today are prone to stereotyping, prejudice, and emotional volatility, a phenomenon that I refer to as social polarization." (Mason 2018)
                    - We may be undergoing another major shift in the parties right now but it is still to early to tell for sure

                    ## Asymmetric Polarization

                    - **Most of the reported hatred** of people of the "other" party is **directed at political elites** not other voters
                        - Source: Druckman, James N., and Matthew S. Levendusky. 2019. "What Do We Measure When We Measure Affective Polarization?" Public Opinion Quarterly 83(1):114–22. doi: 10.1093/poq/nfz003.
                    - Using DW Nominate (political ideology based on votes made) data to show Republicans have gone farther to the right then Democrats to the left (pics on the next slide)
                        - Source: Pew Research Center (March 10, 2022)

                    - Some of this is due to the right being more monolithic/ideological whereas the democratic party is a collective of many different groups

                    - **Illusory Truth Effect**: "[...] tendency to believe false information to be correct after repeated exposure" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_truth_effect))
                    - **Continued Influence Effect**: "[...] the tendency for misinformation to continue influencing people's thinking and decision-making even after it has been corrected or debunked." ([Jason Hreha](https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/continued-influence-effect))
                    - **Confirmation Bias**: the tendency to look for, prefer, interpret, and remember information that confirms their current beliefs (Nickerson 1998)
                    - **Cognitive Dissonance**: "the mental disturbance people feel when they realize their cognitions and actions are inconsistent or contradictory" [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)
                    - **Motivated Reasoning**: uses emotionally biased reasoning to produce justifications or make decisions that are most desired rather than those that accurately reflect the evidence, while still reducing cognitive dissonance
                    - **Echo Chamber**: a media environment in which information and beliefs that confirm prior beliefs are amplified

                    ## Is Social Media Polarizing

                    - This is a hard question to "prove" but there is some interesting research related to the topic
                    - Data from Twitter 2006-2017 (Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral 2018)
                        > "**Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information**, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information." (Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral 2018) emphasis mine
                        - Humans spread fake news more than bots
                    - Analyzed Facebook posts by domain and URL (González-Bailón et al. 2023)
                        - From 1 September 2020 to 1 February 2021 (Includes 2020 Election and January 6th)
                        - Untrustworthy domains or URLs means that they are dis/misinformation
                        - Found that there was segregation both in engagement of URLs but also by exposure to either left or right leaning individuals

                    <h2>Different Social Media Approaches</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Twitter: some moderation, increasingly tried to target misinformation (was a public company)</li>
                        <li>X: says it doesn't moderate at all but Elon has influenced both the algorithm and shut down accounts he doesn't like (privately owned by Elon)</li>
                        <li>Threads: purposely reduces political content in their algorithm (owned by Meta)</li>
                        <li>Mastadon: open source all moderated by communities (open source hosted on private servers)</li>
                        <li>Bluesky: tries to moderate mostly via both community management and allowing for more personal moderation tools (also public benefit company)</li>
