                        ## Reading Discussion 01 Questions

                        1. What is the main argument of the book?
                        1. What is “collective framing”?
                        1. In what way was it a political project?
                        1. What, according to John Hagan, is the connection between the collective framing of street crime and of white-collar crime?
                        1. How does race play into this story?

                        ## Key Points

                        - Politics played a key role:
                            - Leaders view on crime (street vs WCC)
                            > The age of Reagan imposed a realignment of conceptions of the "good" and the "bad" in American life. The Reagan administration vilified risk-taking on our city streets even as it valorized risk-taking in our nation's financial suites. The consequences played out in growing evidence of socioeconomic inequality. When we simultaneously appraise the consequences in the streets and the suites, the full redistributive effects of the age of Reagan reframing of American life become apparent. pg. 211
                            - allowed corporations to get away with a lot (reduced regulation, encouraged risk taking)

                        ## Recent Example

                        - Mormon church fined $5M for obscuring size of portfolio [(ABC News)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/mormon-church-fined-5m-obscuring-size-portfolio-97361472#:~:text=Mormon%20church%20fined%20%245M%20for%20obscuring%20size%20of,METZ%20Associated%20Press%20February%2021%2C%202023%2C%209%3A15%20AM)
                        > The church has agreed to pay $1 million and Ensign Peak will pay $4 million in penalties based on the violation.
                        
                        > Ensign Peak avoided disclosing investments “with the church’s knowledge,” denying the SEC and the public of accurate information required under law, Gurbir Grewal, the agency’s enforcement director, said in a statement.
                        
                        > Federal investigators said for a period of 22 years, the firm violated agency rules and the Securities Exchange Act by not filing paperwork required that disclosed the value of its assets.
                        
                        > Instead, they said Ensign Peak filed the forms through 13 shell companies they created, even as they maintained decision-making power. They also had “business managers,” most employed by the church, sign the required shell company filings.
                        
                        > “The Church was concerned that disclosure of its portfolio, which by 2018 grew to approximately $32 billion, would lead to negative consequences,” the SEC said in a statement announcing the charges.

                        ## How Would This Be Framed?

                        - By Roosevelt Era Individuals?
                        - By Regan Era Individuals?

                        ## Another Take

                        - Church settles case with SEC over financial reporting [(Deseret News)](https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2023/2/21/23602967/church-settles-case-with-sec-over-financial-reporting)

                        > The SEC order alleged that Ensign Peak violated section 13(f) of the Exchange Act by failing to file Forms 13F in Ensign Peak’s name. The church agreed to settle the SEC’s allegation that it caused Ensign Peak’s violations by approving its filing practice.

                        > The SEC order said that in agreeing to a settlement, the church admitted no wrongdoing.
                        
                        > “We allege that the LDS Church’s investment manager, with the church’s knowledge, went to great lengths to avoid disclosing the church’s investments, depriving the Commission and the investing public of accurate market information,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, in a news release. “The requirement to file timely and accurate information on Forms 13F applies to all institutional investment managers, including non-profit and charitable organizations.”
                        
                        > The order contained allegations not addressed by the church, but the settlement brings the investigation to an end.
                        
                        > “From 1997 through 2019 (the church and Ensign Peak) ... failed to file with the Commission certain required forms that would have disclosed the size of the church’s equity portfolio,” the SEC order said.
                        
                        > The church said it wanted to maintain the privacy of its holdings. Some church officials said previously that they wanted to avoid church members following church investments as a roadmap for personal investing because they might not be appropriate to their circumstances.
                        
                        > A church statement said leaders had followed legal advice in its filings.
                        
                        > “Since 2000, Ensign Peak received and relied upon legal counsel regarding how to comply with its reporting obligations while attempting to maintain the privacy of the portfolio. As a result, Ensign Peak established separate companies (LLCs) that each filed Forms 13F instead of a single aggregated filing. Ensign Peak and the church believe that all securities required to be reported were included in the filings by the separate companies,” the church said in a statement released Tuesday.

                        ## Grading Notes

                        - I really wanted to see mention of the encouragement of risk-taking in the suites
                        - Race was overall very well done
                        - More detail helped to get full credit
