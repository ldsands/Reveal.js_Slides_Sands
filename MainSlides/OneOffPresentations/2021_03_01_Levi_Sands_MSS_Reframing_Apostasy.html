                    ## Contested Definitions of Apostasy

                    - Apostasy is used to represent various individuals there is not a consistent application of the term (Cragun and Hammer 2011)
                    - Cragun and Hammer (2011) in an extensive review the _Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion_ and _Sociology of Religion_ that apostate is the most common term used to describe those who exit a religion
                    - The term has been used to describe a very narrow group of individuals and in other cases could describe a very large group individuals
                        - Bromley (1998) defines apostasy as only describing those who defect from, and make a living off of opposition to their former subversive religion
                        - Sherkat (2014) defines apostasy as anyone who

                    ## (Ex)Mormon Context

                    - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints commonly known as the Mormon Church was established in 1830 in New York by Joseph Smith
                    - Frequently had "apostates" who left the religion under contentious circumstances
                    - Rates of those who count themselves members of the church have declined over the past few decades (Knoll and Riess 2017)
                    - Communities for those who have doubts or who have left the church or other Mormon sects

                    ## Exmormon Reddit

                    - Reddit is host to perhaps the largest of these communities with nearly 200,000 members and ~10,000 unique authors each month
                    - Data available through pushshift.io
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Church Definition

                    - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints describes apostasy as consisting of consistently or repeatedly (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 2020):
                        - "acting in clear and deliberate public opposition to the Church, its doctrine, its policies, or its leaders"
                        - "teaching as Church doctrine what is not Church doctrine after being corrected"
                        - "intentionally working to weaken the faith and activity of Church members"
                        - "follow the teachings of apostate sects after being corrected"
                        - "Formally joining another church and promoting its teachings"

                    ## Individual identity term

                    - Most common use of the term often used to separate those who exit and those who stay
                    - "I get the impression a lot of Mormons find conversations with apostates...*uncomfortable*. They either avoid it or just go straight into attack mode because cognitive dissoce and embarrassment are not fun things to feel. That may be the best tool the church has. They don't need to give people persuasive answers. They just have to persuade them to avoid uncomfortable conversations."
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Collective identity term

                    - Another common usage of the term is to refer to all those who identify themselves as being part of the exmormon community
                    - "First things first, i'm so sorry you're hurting. I know that it's absolutely horrible being in such a dark place. I live in another country, so I can't vouch for this, but if you feel in danger please talk to someone - In Provo there is:Wasatch Mental HealthCrisis Line24 hours / 7 days(801) 373-7393There are a group of resources on http://www.provopride.org/resources/ too, including College transfer, scholarship, grants and funding info.Please never forget that the amazing apostates at r/exmormon are here for you, and that you can always call 911 if you are in imminent danger. Virtual secret handshake and hug!"

                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Event term

                    - Apostasy is often used as a term to refer to the process through which members leave the church or "lose" their faith/belief in church doctrine/teachings
                    - "Bob's story is similar to mine in so many ways. My marriage ended because of my "apostasy." I completely relate to Bob sharing how his loss of faith destroyed all intimacy (physical, emotional, etc.) in his marriage. It is such a lonely road.What really stood out, however, is Bob's explanation for why he left Mormonism. I had the exact same conversation with my kids several months ago. I explained that I didn't leave because I no longer believed. And I didn't even leave because of the harmful, terrible policies or un-Christ-like teachings I saw. Rather, I left because TSCC doesn't leave room for faithful descent."
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## State of being term

                    - "Exactly. They don't need to ask why. Not many people really *love* being in The Cult. Whether it's the hours of meetings, garments, tithing, weird temple crap, take your pick, they know why people leave. It sucks to be there. They probably don't want to be there.What they really want to know is what *you* did that landed you in this apostate mindset, so they won't "fall" like you did."

                    ## Re(Framing) Apostasy

                    - The discourse of the exmormon subreddit often reframes apostasy or being an apostate as being positive
                        - Adopt the discourse of church members
                        - Directly refute or contradict the dominate narratives told about apostates
                    - "Speaking the truth about racist prophets was apostacy and put you at risk of having "eternal blessings" stripped from you.  Let that sink in.  Truth = Apostacy"
