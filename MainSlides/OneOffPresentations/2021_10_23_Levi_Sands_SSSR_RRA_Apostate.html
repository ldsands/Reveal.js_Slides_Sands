                        ### Terminology Disclaimer

                        - I will generally use the term Mormon to describe members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the church itself
                        - I will sometimes use other terms used in the exmormon community that some individuals find offensive
                        - TBM(s) - True Believing Mormon
                        - COB - Church Office Building

                        ### Apostates in Religious Literature

                        - Two extremes:
                            - Only those who leave a subversive organization (Bromley 1998)
                            - "for people who report growing up with a religious identity yet now embrace none, apostasy is not too strong a concept. They have rejected their former identity in favor of no religious identification." (Sherkat 2014)
                        - Apostate and other similar terms for religious exiters are framed as being deviant (Cragun and Hammer 2011)
                        - Brooks (2018) showed that some are reclaiming the term
                        - More research into this reclamation can provide insight into identity work (both individual and collective) of religious exiters

                            <h4>Apostasy</h4>
                            <p>Issues of apostasy often have an impact beyond the boundaries of a ward or stake. They need to be addressed promptly to protect others.</p>
                            <p>The bishop counsels with the stake president if he feels that a member's action may constitute apostasy. The bishop or stake president may place informal membership restrictions on the member (see <a class=cross-ref href="/study/manual/general-handbook/32-repentance-and-membership-councils?lang=eng&para=title_number53-p208#title_number53">32.8.3</a>). The stake president promptly counsels with the Area Presidency. However, only the stake president decides whether a membership council or other action is necessary.</p>
                            <p>As used here, <i>apostasy</i> refers to a member engaging in any of the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Repeatedly acting in clear and deliberate public opposition to the Church, its doctrine, its policies, or its leaders</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Persisting in teaching as Church doctrine what is not Church doctrine after being corrected by the bishop or stake president</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Showing a pattern of intentionally working to weaken the faith and activity of Church members</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Continuing to follow the teachings of apostate sects after being corrected by the bishop or stake president</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Formally joining another church and promoting its teachings (Total inactivity in the Church or attending another church does not by itself constitute apostasy. However, if a member formally joins another church and advocates its teachings, withdrawing his or her membership may be necessary.)</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The Savior taught the Nephites that they should continue to minister to a person who has sinned. "But if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my people, that he may not destroy my people" (<a class=scripture-ref href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.31?lang=eng#p31">3rd Nephi 18:31</a>).</p>

                        ### Church Rhetoric

                        <!-- There is a superior intelligence bestowed upon such as obey the Gospel with full purpose of heart, which, if sinned against, the apostate is left naked and destitute of the Spirit of God, and he is, in truth, nigh unto cursing, and his end is to be burned. -->
                        - "When once that light which was in them is taken from them they become as much darkened as they were previously enlightened, and then, no marvel, if all their power should be enlisted against the truth, and they, Judas-like, seek the destruction of those who were their greatest benefactors." ([Joseph Smith <!--The Elders of the Church in Kirtland, to Their Brethren Abroad, Jan. 22, -->1834](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-27?lang=eng&id=p17-p18#p17))
                        - "Pray for your careless and disobedient children; hold on to them with your faith." ([Orson F. Whitney 1929](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2002/09/hope-for-parents-of-wayward-children?lang=eng))
                        <!-- - "Your mountains may be loneliness, doubt, illness, or other personal problems. Your mountains will vary, and yet the answer to each of your challenges is to  -->
                        - "[I]ncrease your faith. That takes work. Lazy learners and lax disciples will always struggle to muster even a particle of faith."<!--Christ Is Risen; Faith in Him Will Move Mountains: --> ([Russell M. Nelson 2021](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/49nelson?lang=eng))
                        - "A quick google search of conference talks and ensign articles reveals a litany of pretty insulting words that describe people who doubt and people who leave. Lazy, careless, sinful, wayword, faithless, contrary, worldly, selfish, deceitful, deceived, defiant." <!-- The Sunstone Podcast Episode 97:  -->[(Liz Brown MacDonald 2021)](https://sunstone.org/e97-the-impact-of-religious-rigidity-on-disaffiliated-young-adults/)

                        - As an individual identity
                        - As a collective identity

                        ### As an Individual Identity
                        
                        - Apostate or heathen is used as an individual identity marker or label. This is frequently used as a celebratory or as a distinguishing identity from some other identity.
                        > "Happy cake day fellow heathen. Enjoy your relationship untainted by the wedge of mormonism. I am truly happy for you." <!-- id: dxdpsd9 - comment: 1 -->
                        - Here is another example of using heathen as a identity to distinguish from another identity. Also, in this example the author is pointing out his previous commitment.
                        > "I think I agree. I think it's funny that on my mission, I was the really good, super excited missionary. I followed all the rules to a T and hated if we weren't giving 110%. I had a companion that would sleep in through scripture study and talked about all the blowjobs he got before his mission. He's super active and an Elder's Quorum president while I'm a heathen." <!-- id: gkvk5k6 - comment: 1 -->

                        ### As a Collective Identity

                        - Both apostate and heathen is used a collective identity label. It is here that pride in the label is most evident.
                        > "Absolutely. That is part of the reason why some Atheists proudly wear a scarlet "A". When I started down the road to apostacy, the scarlet "A" sounded pretty good to me. By the time I arrived at an atheist, I wanted a pair of "A"'s." <!-- id: c2niw91 - comment: 1 -->

                        ### As a Collective Identity

                        - Authors refer to common traits or behaviors of fellow apostates. Here the author points to a positive act/trait that apostates can use in interactions with TBMs.
                        > "I'm of the opinion we shouldn't give them fuel for their bigotry, the more they realize that apostates don't descend into hedonism and remain good people, the more they'll question whether such accusations are true" <!-- id: c0y2gq7 - comment: 1 -->
                        - Unlike the above comment this submission asks what if apostates mobilize.
                        > "Speaking in strictly hypothetical terms... What if? (Please, use your imagination!) What if we stopped being nice and stopped playing by their rules of obedient, reverent and non-confrontational apostasy? What could we do to fuel a level of protest within Mormondom equivalent to the civil rights or women's suffrage movements? Come on people, let's get creative!" <!-- id: 56u66z - comment: 0 -->

                        ### As a Collective Identity

                        - Authors also refer to how others (typically TBMs) treat apostates.
                        > "Probably the mods are from the COB, and they have to keep the place clean from anything nice from apostates" <!-- id: dxe033i - comment: 1 -->

                        > Oh we aren't allowed to be furious. No no no. Then we are just bitter angry apostates who left because we're offended or lazy or wanted to sin. We must force ourselves to smile and show TBMs just how happy we are to be out of the church. |LINEBREAK| For those of us whose spouses are still in? We must not be angry about anything to do with the church ever. Ever. If we show even the slightest glimmer then we are attacking that which they hold most dear. <!-- id: d2nitae - comment: 1 -->

                        ### As a Label Applied by Others

                        - In this submission the author assumes the ward members are applying the apostate label to the author.
                        > So I wore jeans to church today. Why? Simple... I forgot to pickup my dry cleaning yesterday. I'm certain my neighbors probably think I'm going apostate. <!-- id: 4s5y47 - comment: 0 -->

                        > I will drink apostate coffee, wear apostate sexy underwear, show my apostate shoulders, apostate knees and especially apostate inner thighs and underarms. |LINEBREAK| YEAH APOSTATE. |LINEBREAK| And the funny thing is that I never ever thought I was one. <!-- id: dyvgqwn - comment: 1 -->
                        <!-- - As applied to an object in this case to the thoughts of the author. -->

                        ### Confirming/Refuting Apostate Stereotypes

                        - Many posts are attempting to refute negative stereotypes surrounding apostates and apostate behaviors.

                        - Other posts confirm stereotypes.
                        > "Would you rather the church be true or untrue? If you were to decide whether you would want the church to be real or not real what would you prefer? |LINEBREAK| I think I would prefer that it wasn't. I like the idea of being able to decide things for yourself, and not always having to appeal to this God. That's kind of similar to the Mormon idea of "apostates just want to sin," but if God were actually real I would still follow his rules. I would just prefer that instead of having some parental authority tell me I can't drink coffee I choose whether I want to or not myself. [...]" <!-- id: 553s7f - comment: 0 Some reasons people might choose to have a God be real could be the Jesus loving you thing, or wanting heaven, but those have never really had much of an impact on me. |LINEBREAK| What do you guys think? -->

                        ### Taking on the Voice of TBMs

                        - Authors write posts taking on the voice of a TBM.

Further proof you are an evil apostate. |LINEBREAK| The only thing you can do it start lobbying your State Legislators to force all stores to close one day a week - preferrably Sunday. Just like auto dealers have to do in Utah where God's servants run things. -->

                        ### Conclusions and Future Research

                        Conclusions?
                        - Exmormons are using the apostate/heathen labels to describe their identity
                        - Exmormons are also redefining the the label to refute negative stereotypes or sometimes endorse stereotypes (often reframing them into something positive)

                        Future Research
                        - More work to be done on reclaiming the apostate label
                            - Durable or liminal (Newfield 2020)?
                            - Similarities between other exiters from other religious groups?
                        - Investigate the "conversation" occurring between exmormons and church leaders and lay members.
                        - Exmormon influence on wider views of Mormonism
                        - Topic modeling and Natural Language Processing as a promising method for text analysis of Mormon texts.
