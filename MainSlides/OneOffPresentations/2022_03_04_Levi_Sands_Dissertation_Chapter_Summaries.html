                        ## Top Level Overview

                        - Dissertation Overall Theme:
                            - Analyse the development of strategic action fields (3 different subjects)
                            - Heavily dependent on Field Theory (Fligstein and McAdam 2012) for theoretical foundation
                            - Methods focus on a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and qualitative coding
                        - Three Chapters
                            - "Fake Meat" and the development of meat alternatives
                            - Critical Race Theory (CRT) and how it became a "boogeyman" used by the right in US political discourse
                            - Three Options for final chapter:
                                - The assault on the authority of the leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (CoJCoLdS) from the left and the right
                                - Supreme Court as a partisan institution
                                - Another chapter about meat alternatives (could be related to heath or more climate motivations focused, I haven't given this too much thought)

                        ### Expected Contribution to Literature and Publication Focus

                        - Fake Meat Chapter
                            - Market disruption and organizational change
                        - CRT Chapter
                            - How discourse changes and this topic drives conversation in various circles and drives laws and advocacy
                        - Third chapter options
                            - CoJCoLdS
                                - This chapter would focus more on social media, and organizational rhetoric than other chapters (there are also organizational policy changes that can be indirectly connected to popular backlash)
                                - CoJCoLdS has recently been recieving a lot of criticism from the right over COVID so CoJCoLdS is now being "attacked" from both sides
                                    - How liberal exmormons, conservative exmormons, active members/apologists and others all talk about CoJCoLdS authority/leadership and how CoJCoLdS leadership and it's membership is fighting back
                            - Supreme Court
                                - This chapter would focus more directly on media than other chapters
                                - How discourse has shifted discussion about the supreme court to be more critical and specifically that the institution is partisan prompting possible supreme court policy change
                                <!--  - How liberal exmormons (such as those like John Delhin, r/exmormon), conservative exmormons (such as Denver Snuffer or Phil Davis), active members/apologists (such as Public Square Magazine) and others all talk about mormon authority/leadership -->

                        - Fake Meat Chapter (possibly completed)
                            - What we have now:
                                - Press releases from several incumbents and challengers and two related non-profits
                                - Factiva articles from 2010 to June 2021
                            - What could be added (not necessarily needed)
                                - Center for Consumer Freedom - that is being paid (allegedly) by companies to combat meat alternatives
                                - North American Meat Institute (represents meat producers) and their "sustainable" messaging site "Protein PACT"
                                - Good food institute - pro meat alternatives
                                - Sysco (I figured out to scrape this site there was an issue before)
                                - USDA meat labeling regulation proposition and all public comments
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Data Collection Progress: CRT Chapter

                        - CRT Chapter (partially complete)
                            - What we have now:
                                - Factiva articles from 2010 to June 2021 (this should be updated)
                            - What could be added
                                - CRT related laws (both passed) or under consideration
                                - Fox News, evening Opinion shows (this is almost trivial to get these transcripts, I've already got working code)
                                - Any YouTube channel transcripts like for example The Federalist Society, or The Heritage Foundation (again almost trivial I have working code)
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Data Collection Progress: CoJCoLdS

                        - CoJCoLdS Chapter (partially complete)
                            - What we have now:
                                - All of r/exmormon through June 2021 (should be updated through 2021 in the next month)
                                - All of General Conference from 1970-2019 (easy to update) already mostly clean
                                - General Conference ~1942-1970, I don't have this downloaded now but someone else completed the code to do this which makes it trivial to get it
                                - All of the posts of LDS Freedom Forum (ldsff) a forum of Qanon type conservative members (already cleaned)
                            - What could be added
                                - Any YouTube channel transcripts (includes many podcasts) like for example Mormon Stories, Mormon Discussions inc., FairLDS (again almost trivial I have working code)
                                - PublicSquareMag conservative "intellectual" active members who often write articles about topics of interest
                                - I working on a side project (involving ldsff) with someone who has all of the #DezNat tweets I could probably get access to that data
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Data Collection Progress: Supreme Court

                                - Fox News opinion transcripts for shows from ~2019-2020 might be useful
                            - What could be added
                                - Any YouTube channel transcripts (includes many podcasts) like for example PBS, CBS, other news or political orgs (again almost trivial I have working code)
                                - Podcast transcripts for several supreme court related podcasts (left aligned; Strict Scrutiny, ACS podcast; right aligned; The Federalist Society)

                        ### Methods/Analysis Plan

                        - Fake Meat Chapter
                            - Qualitatively Code the codes used in Weber, Heinze, and DeSoucey (2008) possibly with some other "new" codes as well
                            - Possibly topic modeling over time as well (I still need to work on this, LDA is just not cutting it, I haven't completed any of the newer transformers such as BERT yet, the qualitative coding will likely help with this)
                        - CRT Chapter
                            - I plan to do pretty much what we did the fake meat chapter, identify language that is directly related to CRT related discussion and create all of the quantification of those words
                                - The language/word code from fake meat code is not quite plug and play but it is close (I've already adapted most of that code to another project without much difficulty)
                            - Identify cultural codes (similar to Fake Meat chapter but this will need mostly new codes)
                            - Qualitatively code relevant content
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Methods/Analysis Plan

                        - Third chapter options
                            - CoJCoLdS
                                - Pretty much the same as above
                            - Supreme Court
                                - Pretty much the same as above
                        - Most of the methods should be very similar between the chapters
                            - If for example the topic modeling is more useful for one of the chapters that would take more focus in the analysis

                        ### Update on Fake Meat

                        - Qualitative Coding - oppositional structures from Weber, Heinze, and DeSoucey (2008)
                            - authenticity vs. manipulation
                                - authentic: sincere, honest, transparent, connected
                                - manipulation: instrumental, deceitful, obscured, decoupled
                            - sustainability vs. exploitation
                                - sustainability: Permanence, Nurturing, Conservation, Renewable resource
                                - exploitation: destruction, depleting, extraction, commodity resource
                            - natural vs. artificial
                                - natural: pure, clean, healthy, complete
                                - artificial: spoilt, dirty, unhealthy, fragmented
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Overall Summary of Codes Used by NCBA

                        - authenticity vs manipulation: the NCBA mostly uses the authenticity vs manipulation codes by framing themselves as producing authentic meat while challengers are manipulative by using meat as a label on their "fake meat" product
                        - natural vs. artificial: the NCBA frames their product as natural and nutritious whereas they state that "fake meat" is artificial and that it is either not nutritious or that challengers are overstating the nutritional value of "fake meat"
                        - sustainability vs. exploitation: this is largely missing from the press releases that contain "fake meat"
                            - I think that maybe the leveling the playing field could be coded in the exploitation code since it seems like the NCBA is framing the challengers as taking advantage of the meat brand/name/label to market their "fake meat"
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Other Possible Codes (NCBA)

                        - fairness/justice
                            - they often talk of leveling the playing field or fairness of the incumbents (cattle ranchers) vs challengers espcially in the labeling context
                                - example: "encourage usda to look beyond modifying standards of identity in order to provide adequate protection for beef producers and consumers it is critical that the federal government step up to the plate and enforce fair and accurate labeling for fake meat said kevin kester president of ncba as long as we have a level playing field our product will continue to be a leading protein choice for families"

                        ### Big National News Orgs

                        - for more news type articles some of the NCBA's arguments are summarized
                        - there is a lot of usage of environmental topics as a motivation for trying and eating regularly "fake meat" products
                        - there is a lot of describing other issues with challenger's products such as price or as these products don't go far enough to address environmental/social justice issues
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Other Possible Codes (Big National News Orgs)

                        - there are several uses of people making changes like eating "fake meat" for environmental purposes while ignoring other issues such as highly processed (i.e. bad for health) foods or not really cutting meat consumption, big companies getting tax breaks thus helping them in their bad (for environment or people) practices
                            - example: "we have been trained from birth to enjoy them we will continue to eat cheeseburgers the easiest way for us to eat fewer cheeseburgers is to produce fewer cheeseburgers or at least to price them at their true cost one that includes their contributions to climate change public health environmental degradation and so on this would make them prohibitively expensive high tech fake meat isnt the answer because even though vegan ultra processed food doesnt kill animals it kills people"
                        - the price of challenger's products is another topic I'm not sure what to do with
                            - example: "i m also annoyed by the cost why pay more for fake meat than real meat especially since the production process is faster easier and involves no butchering and i have felt if you want to eat less meat why not just eat more of other real things"
                        - heath may fit into sustainability but I think it may also stand as it's own code, e.g. "seeing growing consumer demand for less fat cholesterol and calories which often translates into a desire to eat less meat"
