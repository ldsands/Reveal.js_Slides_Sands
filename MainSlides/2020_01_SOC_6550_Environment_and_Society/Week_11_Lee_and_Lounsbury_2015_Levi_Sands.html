                    ## Institutional Logics

                    - Institutional logics are the paradigms that exist withing organizations which dictate priorities, actions, reactions, etc.
                    - Different institutional logics can lead to very different outcomes for organizations
                    - There is never just one institutional logic, rather there are many at any given moment that compete within an organization
                    - Institutional logics can and do vary, sometimes dramatically in different places
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Research Context: Industrial Toxic Pollution Governance

                    - Industrial toxic waste began to become a problem in the public consciousness in the 1970s
                    - Love Canal in particular catapulted the issue of toxic waste into the national and international spotlight
                    - This awareness resulted in community and environmental protection becoming an institutional logic
                    - These new environmental logics must compete with other institutional logics in organizations
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Political Affiliation and Environmental Logics
                    - Those who identify as politically conservative value economic progress over environmental protection
                    - People with similar political attitudes are frequently clustered together in communities
                </section>
            </section>

                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Research Questions
                    - How do some institutional logics get prioritized over other institutional logics within organizations
                </section>
            <!-- Research Questions and Literature Contribution  -->

            <!-- Hypotheses -->
            <section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Hypotheses
                    - Hypothesis 1: Facilities in communities dominated by a politically conservative logic will be less likely to improve their environmental performance.
                    - Hypothesis 2: Facilities in communities dominated by a proenvironmental logic will be more likely to improve their environmental performance.
                    - Hypothesis 3: Facilities facing pressure from the EPA will be less likely to improve their environmental performance if they are embedded in communities dominated by a politically conservative logic.
                    - Hypothesis 4: Facilities facing pressure from the EPA will be more likely to improve their environmental performance if they are embedded in communities dominated by a proenvironmental logic.
                    - Hypothesis 5: Facilities that face market logic pressures will be more likely to improve their environmental performance if they are embedded in communities dominated by a politically conservative logic.
                    - Hypothesis 6: Facilities embedded in communities dominated by a proenvironmental logic will be no more inﬂuenced by the market logic than facilities in communities not dominated by a proenvironmental logic.

                    ## Hypotheses simplified
                    - Hypothesis 1 upon Gasland’s release AND award nominations...
                    - &uparrow; searches related to fracking
                    - &uparrow; fracking social media posts
                    - &uparrow; calls for bans on fracking (on social media)
                    - Hypotheses 2 - 4 where Gasland is screened...
                    - &uparrow; local opposition to fracking
                    - &uparrow; fracking bans
                    - &uparrow; fracking bans (through indirect means)

                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Methods
                    - Data Sources
                        - The levels of benzene release by various chemical facilities in Texas and Louisiana from the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) 1991 - 2003 (118 facilities from 34 communities or counties)
                        - Center for Responsive Politics’ database of political donations
                    - Statistical Method Used
                        - Hierarchical linear models
                    - Dependent Variable
                        - BIR (benzene internalization rate) = ratio between the amount of benzene internalized and the total waste generated
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Methods cont.
                    - Main Independent Variables
                        - For a measure of politically conservative the authors used political contributions given to the Republican Party by corporate executives in each county for each year aggregated by county (they then took a natural log of the variable to correct for any skewedness pg 856)
                        - For a measure of proenviornmental logic they used several measures related to environmental movement organizations in the local community along with reports of activist activity and reports of civil lawsuits against a facility in the area
                        - State Logic which is measured by EPA enforcement actions
                        - Market Logic which is measured by the total estimated cost of the off-site transfer of waste for each facility
                    - Control Variables
                        - Increase in use of benzene year over year
                        - Facility size (represented by by the natural log of benzene waste generated)
                        - Per-capita income, Percent minority, Spillover effect from neighboring counties, County environmental risk index,

            <!-- Results -->
            <section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Results
                    - The results show that the strength of the two main type of logics measured (proenviornmental and politically conservative) od have an impact on how the organizations operate

                    ## My Thoughts
                    - I'm a little skeptical of the TRI data given that it seems to be self reported and although it is required by law those laws are a bit more flexible (especially lately) than one would think
                        - This is a minor criticism given the nature of what data is available it seems as though the TRI is likely the best available in the US
                    - I liked the description of different community paradigms or "logics" compete and can influence organizations but that they also compete with each other for mindshare
                    - I think an interesting followup study (though probably very impractical) would be to somehow see how the local residents think about the facilities in their communities and see if, for example, those who identify as more politically conservative but are in an area where the proenviornmental logics are strong also show leanings in the proenviornmental direction due to the stronger proenviornmental community logics
