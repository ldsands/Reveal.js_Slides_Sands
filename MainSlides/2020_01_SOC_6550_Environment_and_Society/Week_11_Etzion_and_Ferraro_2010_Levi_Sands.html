                    ## Institutional Entrepreneurship and Changing Institutional Culture

                    - Institutional entrepreneurship is the process of trying to enact change in an institution.
                    - This process is difficult because of two conflicting goals
                        1. changing current practices
                        1. not drawing ire those who have a vested interest in resisting any change

                    ## Analogies in Institutions

                    - An analogy is a figure of speech that is used to show the similarities between two objects or ideas
                    - Analogies As Enablers Of Change
                        - Analogies are used to help the process of institutionalization
                            - This happens through linking a new practice with an already established practice
                        - by using analogies the entrepreneur can effectively appear to be using legitimate "parts" used in other areas of the same or similar institution and create change
                        - this allows the entrepreneur to implement change into an institution while framing it as something that is not as new or drastic as it could be seen otherwise
                    - Analogies As Cognitive "Cages"
                        - analogies have also been described as conservative as they limit potential exploration by framing something as being similar to some other established idea or practice
                        - imagination and creativity has been shown to decline when an analogy is used in the introduction of a new idea (Dahl and Moreau 2002)

                    ## GRI and Corporate Sustainability

                    - The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a nonprofit organization that is dedicated to institutionalizing sustainability practices and reporting worldwide.
                    - Founded in 1997 with the goal of incorporating representation from all stakeholders in the development of their detailed reporting schema
                    - Soon after its founding the organization moved from just environmental reporting to social and economic reporting as well

                    ## Research Question
    
                    <!-- - Does the use of analogy in institutional entrepreneurship promote legitimacy of changes in an organization or limit the changes made due to linking to established practices. -->
                    - How does the use of analogy change as institutionalization occurs?

                    - Data Sources
                        - Many different documents associated with the creation and modification of the GRI's sustainability guidelines over the years
                    - Analysis method used
                        - hand coding based on the principles of discourse analysis

                    ## Results

                    - Early on analogies were used frequently to establish legitimacy
                        - they used the analogy of financial reporting often
                            - they drew upon both similarities between financial reporting and contrasts or modifications to help drive change in the thinking of the corporations
                            - Also early on they described the motivation in terms of beneficial financial consequences
                    - By the time that the Third iteration of the guidelines were released there were many changes in the number and how analogies were used
                        - Before the release of the third iteration of the guidelines t he GRI had become, "de facto standard for sustainability reporting"
                        - This allowed the GRI to decrease dramatically reduce their use of the financial reporting analogies used in earlier iterations with great frequency
                        - The use of linking to economic outcomes have all but been removed from this third iteration of the guidelines

                    ## My Thoughts on this Article

                    - On a slightly personal note I really enjoyed the philosophical question of analogies or comparison limiting imagination at the same time as it allows progress
                    - They're use of the data I think is very interesting and something that I doubt I would of ever thought of as a possibility
                    - They're use of discourse analysis is I think very apt for what they are doing in this instance
                        - my understanding of discourse analysis is limited but I think the involvement here needed by discourse analysis is a very good choice for setting up many possible followup studies
                    - I would really like to see a quantitative followup study
                        - I think that they could do some limited discourse analysis on many different companies or new organizations and then find certain keywords to search for and then document how the keywords related to analogies change over time as institutionalization occurs (or fails to occur)
