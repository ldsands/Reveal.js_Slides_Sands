                            <li class="fragment">I internalized this trust to the point that I did things that many others considered extreme.</li>
                            <li class="fragment">For example, I was taught by these leaders that coffee was the devil's bean and thus coffee was "bad." As a result of the internalization of these teachings I never had coffee. I would even get sick to my stomach just from the smell of coffee.</li>
                            <li class="fragment">When I was 19 I became a missionary. This role required me to prepare for proselytizing and proselyte for 16 hours 6 days every week. On the 7th day half of the day was still reserved for proselytizing.</li>
                            <li class="fragment">My whole identity was consumed by the role of being a missionary. My old role and identity was at conflict with the new identity that the missionary role provided me. Gradually the missionary identity "won out." I never even used my first name for two years.</li>
                            <li class="fragment">I did become able to teach effectively in many different situations because of my time as a missionary.</li>
                            <li class="fragment">Due to the extreme trust I had in my leaders they were easily able to exert social control over me.</li>
                            <li class="fragment">I had to actively suppress critical thinking to avoid developing "doubts." I had to learn the ability to critically think much later in life and I still have difficulty with these skills.</li>
