                    ## This is not a research presentation

                    - As I created my first draft of the questionnaire I couldn't help but think about how different my survey might be from other surveys that are on this same(ish) topic
                    - There are three surveys done with Ex-Mormons/former Mormons in the past few years
                    - Since I will likely not continue with this exact research topic for many years I figured I should try to do something fun for this presentation
                    - I will present questions from each survey that were meant to obtain the same(ish) information
                        - I will ask each of you to try and match which set of questions belongs to which survey(or) at the end
                        - I will also be taking a vote for which question you like the best for each of the questions I will be showing
                            - Ideally I would like you to pick the question you think is the best according to the principles we learned in class

                    ## Contextual Background

                    - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon/LDS Church)
                    - The largest branch of the Latter-day Saint movement started by Joseph Smith Jr. in upstate New York 1830
                    - Claims to have over 16 million members (Burningham 2011)
                        - This number is very inflated as only about a third are "active"
                        - Accelerating number of members becoming "disillusioned"
                    - High-cost or demand religion (Scheitle and Adamczyk 2010)
                        - "[H]igh levels of required participation, behavioral and social restrictions"
                        - High cost of leaving the religion

                    ## Surveys of interest

                    - All surveys
                        - Are targeted at Ex-Mormons
                        - Were written in the last 4 years
                        - Were written by academics
                        - Were written by individuals who have identified as Mormons for multiple decades each
                        - Are really long (~30 minutes or more)
                        - All released to public (some not yet)

                    ## Disclaimer

                    - some of the questions have (very) slight wording changes to make it a bit more challenging
                        - I usually just changed the tense to present
                        - I did this just to keep the guessing interesting

                    ## My Thoughts
