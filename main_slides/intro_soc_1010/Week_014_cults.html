                            <li>This is not meant as an attack on any religion particularly christianity however since my experience is from a christian church there will be some of their doctrine and beliefs used as examples</li>
                            <li>I encourage you to think of other examples of organizations that you are familiar with and think about how they use some of these same methods to discourage independence</li>
                            <li>Not all of these "mind control" methods are inheritably good or evil</li>

                            <li>John Goldhammer - “Special loving attention given to new members is a common technique used by many groups and appeals to a person’s innate longing to be accepted and loved. All this attention is an immediate, intoxicating, and potent hook, not only making it difficult for a new member to leave, but reinforcing the addictive need to keep returning to the group… I call this the warm fuzzies trap.”</li>
